# Key files — per-file index (gbrain repo)

Read a file's entry before editing it. This page routes to bounded subsystem
references; **do not load every file in the directory**. Entries retain the
implementation evidence and test references from the former single-file index.

Find a specific path locally, then read that entry and its surrounding contract:

```bash
rg -n -F 'src/core/ops/pages.ts' docs/architecture/key-files/
```

The ranges below use the first path in each entry; grouped entries can document
several related files. Search is the fallback when a path crosses subsystems.
Edit the subsystem entry, not this routing page, when behavior changes.
Keep entries current-state: release history belongs in `CHANGELOG.md` and Git.
Where a new storage method, migration, doctor check, command, route or sync
phase goes: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#where-does-my-change-go).
A branch written before refactor wave 1 follows the generated
[porting guide](wave-1-porting.md) ([JSON map](wave-1-moves.json)).
`scripts/check-key-files-current-state.sh` checks every subsystem for history,
duplicate file entries, and size growth. Split a growing subsystem at a useful
boundary and add its link here rather than raising the cap.
