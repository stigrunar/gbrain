# decide: the System One capability contract

`decide` is GBrain's provider-agnostic decision layer: typed questions over
typed evidence, answered by TypeSafe's Jev (the first provider) or by any
configured chat model (`llm:<provider:model>`), with receipts, calibration,
qualification, drift protection and one egress contract. Code owns every
threshold. This page is the contract slot lanes build on; the operator guide
is `docs/guides/system-one.md`.

Every slot is `off` or `on`. `shadow` exists for diagnostics only (receipts,
no behavior change) and nothing requires passing through it.

**Key-aware defaults.** `readDecideConfig(snapshot, { typesafeKey })` turns on
`recommendedSlots(DEFAULT_TYPESAFE_PROVIDER)` (reference rows with verdict
`win` and a passing gate, the same set `enable --recommended` uses: today
`triage` and `conflict`) when a TypeSafe key is present and the operator set
nothing explicit for the slot. Such a slot carries `keyDefault: true`, uses
the pinned provider, and `checkEgress(..., { slot })` treats the key as
consent for that slot's classes and the private opt-in for its conversation
and fact items (never pages). Explicit settings win: the slot's mode or
provider, `decide.provider none`, `decide.egress.private deny`, a `deny`
consent key for the slot's class. Callers that omit `typesafeKey` (and every
eval run) get no defaults. Call sites that read live config pass
`hasTypesafeKey()`: `loadDecideState`, the dream-cycle slots, the sweep and
`loadDecideConfig`. A slot requested
`on` that cannot act (no calibration, drift, a changed policy, the
action-precision gate, missing consent) runs with **off behavior** for that
call, writes a receipt with the reason, and shows `on (inactive: <reason>)`
plus the one fix command in `gbrain decide status` and `gbrain doctor`.

## API

```ts
import { runDecide } from 'src/core/ai/decide/index.ts';   // or gateway.decide(req, ctx)

const result = await runDecide({
  slot: 'evidence',            // DecideSlot
  callSite: 'search',          // calibrations and receipts key on (slot, call site)
  state: { query: { text: q, class: 'query' } },           // shared, sent once per batch
  questions: [{
    id: 'evidence:0', kind: 'noul', rank: 0,                  // noul | choice (options) | score (levels)
    instructions: 'Does `candidate` contain evidence that helps answer `query`?',
    inputs: { candidate: { text, class: 'candidates', slug, source_id } },
  }],
  deadlineMs: 1500,            // bounds the whole logical decision (all batches)
}, { engine, config });        // engine: egress page check, spend ledger, daily cap
```

- **Questions** are a discriminated union (`src/core/ai/decide/types.ts`):
  `noul` (a probability), `choice` (`options: Record<label, description>`),
  `score` (`levels: string[]`). Ids are stable and code-only.
- **Answers** mirror the wire: `{kind:'noul', p}`, `{kind:'choice', choice,
  confidence, probabilities}`, `{kind:'score', score, normalized, confidence,
  probabilities}`. `thresholdValue(answer)` is the number a threshold compares.
- **Result**: `decision_id, provider, model_alias, model_resolved, answers,
  refused, fallback?, usage, cost_usd, latency_ms, batches, lane`.
- **Failure** throws `DecideError` with a catalogued `reason` (`timeout`,
  `rate_limited`, `provider_error`, `malformed_response`, `mixed_model`,
  `budget_exhausted`, `no_key`, `no_provider`, `pinned_model_unavailable`,
  `payload_too_large`, `late`, `llm_capability`). The caller takes its slot's
  documented fail direction. Partial answers are never used: a missing id or
  a non-numeric or out-of-range value fails the whole decision.
- **Evidence items** carry provenance (`class`, `source_id`, and `slug`,
  `fact_id` or `transcript_ref`, plus `visibility` for facts). Items with
  missing provenance are refused before serialization.

## Providers

| Provider | Wire | Identity | Spend |
|---|---|---|---|
| `typesafe:jev-1.13.0` (pinned default; `jev-latest`/`jev-preview` accepted with a doctor warning) | `POST /v1/systemone`, Bearer `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` (alias `JEV_TYPESAFE_API_KEY`) | response `model` | `decide_spend` row per request, `BudgetKind` `decide` (S1 `on`: `rerank`) |
| `llm:<provider:model>` | `chat()` with a JSON schema; answers strictly validated by the same parser | provider-reported snapshot, else requested id + endpoint fingerprint | once, by `chat()`, kind `chat`, purpose `decide:<slot>` |

Within one logical decision, mixed resolved model ids fail it (`mixed_model`).
`on` refuses an `llm:` route whose path ignores structured output
(`llm_capability`). Key presence never selects a provider.

## Packing and runtime

`pack.ts`: shared state once per batch, one question per candidate, a
conservative 2x token estimate with a digit floor, split before send (64k per
request, 32k for state plus the longest question), never truncate evidence,
questions ordered by rank then id. `runBatches`: at most `decide.max_concurrency`
(hot, default 16) or `decide.background_concurrency` (background, default 4)
requests in flight under one deadline; a 429 `retry-after` is honored once only
when it fits the deadline; background lanes drop to one worker after a 429.
`runtime.ts`: `decide.query_budget_ms` bounds the latency decide work adds to
one query (`stageDeadlineMs`, stages skip with `late`). Retrieval and expansion
time is not decide time: the first post-retrieval stage (S1 in `hybrid/rank.ts`,
or the S3/S4 gate on the keyword-only path, or S4 after think's gather) calls
`budget.anchor()`, which restarts the clock minus the time S2's wait blocked
(`budget.charge`). Detached shadow work runs under
its own `BudgetTracker`, behind a bounded queue, drained at CLI exit.

`unpacked.ts` `runDecideUnpacked`: slots whose answers must not depend on
co-packed neighbours (S7 windows, S8 claim units) send one question per request
as one logical decision (one decision id and deadline, a process-wide
background-lane cap, per-question failure reasons so a slot can require
complete coverage).

`packShape(slot, coPacked, {unpacked})` names the request shape a calibration
is valid for; `on` refuses a calibration with a different shape
(`pack_shape_mismatch`).

## Policy, calibration and qualification

`policy.ts` `resolveSlotPolicy(inputs)` returns requested and effective mode,
the inactive cause, provider, lookup model, threshold and its source, the
calibration, `min_keep`, the margin and the policy fingerprint.

- Threshold precedence: `decide.slots.<slot>.threshold` (operator override;
  never drift-demoted; does not bypass the gate) > the adopted calibration
  (`decide.slots.<slot>.calibration`, written by `enable`/`adopt`) > the newest
  local `decide_calibrations` row for (slot, call site, provider, model) > a
  shipped reference row (`reference-calibrations.ts`).
- Alias providers look up calibrations under the model most recently resolved
  in receipts. After a response, a resolved id different from the calibration
  demotes that call (`driftReason` → `model_drift`).
- Margin: `max(decide.margin_floor, 2 * max(retest_sd, repack_sd))`. A
  harmful-direction answer inside the margin takes the no-change outcome
  `margin_hold`.
- Harmful-direction slots need a qualified calibration:
  `action_precision_lb` (family-level Wilson 95% lower bound after the
  production reducer) at least `decide.slots.<slot>.min_action_precision`
  (0.90), bound to the policy fingerprint (threshold, margin rule, floors,
  protections, question version, call site, pack shape). A mismatch is
  `policy_changed`. `decide.slots.<slot>.force_on` bypasses the gate and is
  always listed by doctor. `insufficient_n` names the n needed (35 at 0.90).

`calibrate.ts` holds the math; `dataset.ts` the JSONL schema, the frozen
family split (`split_hash`) and per-slot adapters that build production-shaped
requests.

## Receipts, spend and state

`store.ts` reads and writes through `engine.executeRaw` (no engine method).
`decision_receipts` rows hold hashes only (`subject_ref`, `state_hash`,
`question_hash` are HMAC-SHA256 under a per-brain salt kept in `decide_state`,
which no config surface reads), the thresholded number, the outcome, and the
fields replay needs (`protected`, `rank`, `min_keep`, `decision_id`).
Receipts and spend rows are buffered and flushed fire-and-forget, registered
with the background-work drain (500 ms bound at CLI exit). Retention:
`decide.receipts.retention_days` (7), pruned by the cycle `purge` phase. The
daily cap sums `decide_spend` for the UTC day (third-party only; cached 60 s;
soft in both directions); remote-triggered spend is capped by
`decide.budget.remote_share`.

### S9 proposals and sweep state

`decide_proposals` rows (`pending | accepted | rejected | stale | undone`)
are never pruned by receipt retention. The sweep keeps one internal
`decide_state` key per source (`conflict_watermark:<source>`) and retries
transient skips from `decide_sweep_deferred` (at most 5 attempts). Accept
and undo are the only S9 writes to facts: a checked supersede that stores
before/after state (`expired_at`, `valid_until`, `superseded_by`, the fence
row, the page revision) and applies the database and fence changes as one
unit; on managed brains it is the coordinator mutation `decide_proposal`.

### Outcome vocabulary (canonical: `src/core/ai/decide/outcomes.ts`)

<!-- decide-outcomes:begin -->
| Slot | Plain name | Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| rerank | search reranking | kept |
| intent | query routing | override, fallback_regex |
| evidence | evidence gate | kept, pruned, margin_hold |
| answerable | abstention | pass, abstain, margin_hold, incomplete |
| injection | injection signal | demoted, kept |
| recall_needed | know-to-ask | fire, no_fire, suppress, margin_hold |
| triage | dream triage | pass, reject, margin_hold |
| grounding | claim support | pass, quarantine, insufficient_context, margin_hold |
| conflict | contradiction | duplicate, proposal, independent |
<!-- decide-outcomes:end -->

Every slot may also record `error` or `skipped`, with `error_reason` from
`SKIP_REASONS`. Refusals and inactive causes come from `REFUSAL_CATALOG`
(problem, cause, exact fix, docs anchor). `test/decide/docs-sync.test.ts`
pins this table to the code.

## Retrieval slots (S2, S4, S5)

- **S2 intent.** Search: launched as soon as hybridSearch resolves its decide
  context (alongside the regex classifier), awaited at most
  `decide.slots.intent.wait_ms`; an `override` (above threshold, a known label
  that differs from and does not tie the regex label) replaces the
  `QueryIntent` before weights, detail and search options are derived, through
  the same code the regex path uses. Everything else keeps the regex label
  (`fallback_regex`; a late answer's receipt lands later with reason `late`).
  The search question always keys on call site `search`. Think: its own
  question (`temporal | knowledge_update | other`, call site `think`) replaces
  `classifyIntent` for trajectory gating; think asks the search question once
  and hands the answer to gather.
- **S4 answerable.** Always its own request (`pack_shape` unpacked). `query`
  op: over the pre-S3 top-k, concurrent with the S3/S5 request, diagnostic
  only (`meta.answerability { p, threshold, verdict, k_used }`; results never
  change). `think`: over the final gathered pages and sendable takes after
  gather; abstains (lists the nearest pages, skips synthesis) only on
  `abstain`, which needs complete coverage (no k shrink, nothing withheld by
  egress, no private take, no trajectory block) and no deterministic signal
  (identity hit, strong CRAG grade without S3's input). Harmful: `on` needs a
  qualified calibration or `force_on`.
- **S5 injection.** Rides the S3-shaped request. `on` stamps `injection_p`,
  flags candidates at threshold that the protection predicate does not
  protect (`injection_suspected`), moves them below the clean candidates of
  their `classifyEvidence` class without crossing the S3 `min_keep` cut, and
  `think` adds an `injection_suspected` line to the flagged page's untrusted
  wrapper. Never drops content, never gates a write, never a security
  boundary. Datasets: `--from injection-fixtures` (#5178's known cases,
  credited to dsandrade).

## Egress (one contract for every path)

`egress.ts` `checkEgress`: a third-party provider receives a data class only
with consent (`decide.egress.typesafe.<class>`, written by `gbrain decide
enable` after it shows what leaves the machine; for S1 `on`, the reranker
selection is the consent for query and candidate text, as with Voyage).
`decide.egress.deny_sources` applies to every provider. Private content never
leaves without `decide.egress.private=allow`: page candidates are checked by
one batched query per decision with `privatePagesFilterFragment` (including
the #5525 derived-origin rule), facts by their own visibility (default
private), conversation text is private. Refused questions are answered by
`decide.egress_fallback` (an `llm:` route) as their own sub-decision, else take
the fail direction. `llm:` follows today's chat egress rules.

**Jev reranker and denied sources (owner decision, 2026-09-30).** When the
Jev reranker is active (`search.reranker.model typesafe:*`, reranking
enabled) and any rerank candidate (the `top_n_in` head) comes from a source in
`decide.egress.deny_sources`, the query skips reranking and keeps fused (RRF)
order. The skip is stamped `degraded: reranker_skipped (egress_denied)` (an
`--explain` line on every query); with `decide.slots.rerank.mode` not off it
also writes `skipped` receipts with reason `egress_denied` and a
`decide rerank: on (inactive: egress_denied)` line. Partial reranking of the
allowed candidates is not attempted: it would reorder denied candidates by
omission.

## Trust

`decide` is not an MCP operation. Remote callers reach slots only through
`query`/`think`; their spend is counted as remote. `gbrain decide` is local
CLI only (`thinClient: 'refuse'`); calibrate, receipts review and proposal
acceptance never run for a remote caller.

## Fixed by design versus configurable

| Knob | Value | Configurable |
|---|---|---|
| Request / state+question token limits | 64k / 32k | no (provider limits) |
| Max concurrent batches | 16 hot, 4 background | `decide.max_concurrency`, `decide.background_concurrency` (1-16) |
| Margin floor | 0.05 | `decide.margin_floor` |
| S3 judged candidates | first 50 of the return pool (tail kept) | no (`EVIDENCE_MAX_CANDIDATES`) |
| S3 `min_keep` | 3 | `decide.slots.evidence.min_keep` |
| Per-query decide budget | 1500 ms | `decide.query_budget_ms` |
| Per-decision timeout (hot) | 1500 ms | `decide.timeout_ms` |
| Shadow in-flight queue | 8 | no |
| Retest sample | 50 families, 3 repeats | `decide.calibrate.retest_n` |
| S6 deadline (from turn start, concurrent with reflex) | 250 ms | no (`RECALL_NEEDED_DEADLINE_MS`; also capped by `decide.timeout_ms`) |
| S6 fire: minimum server budget left / response margin / hits | 150 ms / 40 ms / 3 | no |
| S6 state caps (prompt head / previous-turn tail) | 6,000 / 2,000 characters | no |
| S6 suppression boundary | 0.10 (0.05 before 2026-09-30: with the 0.05 margin floor it could never suppress) | `decide.slots.recall_needed.suppress_below` (bound into the policy fingerprint) |
| S7 window | whole turns, about 1,500 chars; a turn over 24,000 chars splits at paragraphs (marked); at most 256 windows per transcript (more → today's triage) | no (`TRIAGE_WINDOW_CHARS`, `TRIAGE_TURN_SPLIT_CHARS`, `TRIAGE_MAX_WINDOWS`) |
| S7 decision deadline / segment map | 60 s per transcript; top 8 windows, 300-char quotes | no |
| S8 source windows / coverage floor | 3 per claim; 0.25 of the claim's content words | no (`GROUNDING_MAX_WINDOWS`, `GROUNDING_KEYWORD_FLOOR`) |
| S8 deadlines | 30 s per page, 10 min per dream phase | no |
| S4 k | per slot lane | documented with each slot |
| S2 wait for the intent answer | 250 ms (measured: 39% of live Jev answers arrive after 150 ms, 3% after 250 ms; docs/eval/system-one/) | `decide.slots.intent.wait_ms` |
| S4 k | min(10, evidence count), shrunk to fit 32k | no (`ANSWERABLE_MAX_K`) |
| S5 demotion floor | the S3 `min_keep` cut (default 3) | via `decide.slots.evidence.min_keep` |
| S6 budgets, S8 window count, S7 window size/cap | per slot lane | documented with each slot |
| Eval pool depth (recall experiment) | per-arm cap 100 (`MAX_SEARCH_LIMIT`) | eval-only: `gbrain eval longmemeval --eval-pool-depth N` (N ≤ 300, `src/core/search/eval-pool-depth.ts`); no config key |

## Extension points for slot lanes

- `SLOT_SPECS[slot].wired` (`slots.ts`): flip when the slot is wired at its
  call site with tests; unwired slots are refused (`slot_unavailable`).
- `registerEvidenceCoPack(handler)` (`src/core/search/decide-stage.ts`): add
  questions to the S3 packed request (S5): `questions(query, candidates,
  policy)` with ids prefixed `<slot>:` (index i asks about candidate i), and
  `apply(pool, result, policy, ctx, judged)` returning the pool (never below
  the S3 `min_keep` cut), receipt outcomes and an optional skip reason
  (drift). A co-packed slot always rides the S3-shaped request, one
  `pack_shape`: when S3 is off or inactive, the request still carries the S3
  questions (S3 records and applies nothing) so a co-packed slot's
  calibration stays valid; a co-packed slot `on` makes the request
  synchronous even when S3 is shadow.
- `registerDatasetAdapter(adapter)` / `registerDatasetBuilder(source, builder)`
  (`dataset.ts`): production-shaped requests, harmful-action reducers, and
  `gbrain decide dataset --from <source>` builders.
- `registerDecideSubcommand(name, run, help)` (`src/commands/decide.ts`):
  `proposals`, `sweep`, `judge-agreement`. Lane modules that register
  subcommands, what-if reducers or dataset adapters are imported by
  `loadDecideLanes()` (write path: `src/commands/decide/writepath.ts`; eval
  harness: `src/commands/decide/eval-lane.ts`, whose `judge-agreement`
  dispatches without a brain and keeps its kappa math in
  `src/core/ai/decide/judge-agreement.ts`).
- `SlotDatasetAdapter.unpacked` / `aggregate: 'max'` (`dataset.ts`): calibrate
  and qualify send one request per question and fold several questions into
  one item value (S7 transcript = max window).
- `registerWhatIfReducer(slot, reducer)` (`src/commands/decide/receipts.ts`)
  for slots whose reducer replays exactly (S7, S8).
- `writeReceipts(engine, input)` (`receipts.ts`) and the per-request
  `DecideSearchContext` (`req.decide` in hybrid search) for search-path slots;
  `resolveSlotPolicy`, `stageDeadlineMs`, `runShadow` and `sampled` for all.
- `enableDecideEvalOverride()` (`config.ts`): eval commands opt in to
  `GBRAIN_DECIDE_SLOTS`, which never bypasses consent, egress or the cap.
- `src/eval/decide-eval-flags.ts`: the `--decide*` flags every eval command
  shares (`prepareDecideEval` merges flags over the inherited env, sets it and
  opts in; `configureDecideBrain` configures a throwaway benchmark brain;
  `operatorBrainRefusal` guards a connected brain; `decideRowReceipt` and
  `summarizeDecideReceipts` build per-row receipts from `DecideSlotMeta` plus
  the brain's `decide_spend` delta). A new slot's eval receipt comes for free
  once its call site writes `ctx.meta.<slot>`; slot-specific row fields go in
  the eval's lane module (LongMemEval: `src/eval/longmemeval/decide-lane.ts`).

## How to add a slot

1. Add its spec in `slots.ts` (lane, question kind, harmful, call sites,
   egress classes, defaults, fail direction) and its outcomes in
   `outcomes.ts` (then update the table above).
2. Build questions with provenance; call `runDecide` under the slot's
   deadline (`stageDeadlineMs`); catch `DecideError` and take the fail
   direction.
3. Write ONE pure action reducer shared by production, `qualify` and evals;
   honor `margin`, floors and the protection predicate (`protection.ts`) where
   the slot can remove or demote content.
4. Resolve the policy once per request (`resolveSlotPolicy`), check
   `driftReason` after the response, and write receipts for every outcome,
   including skipped and error rows.
5. Register a dataset adapter so `calibrate`/`qualify` use the production
   shape; add unit, PGLite and all-off golden tests; flip `wired`.

### Example: a custom slot on either provider

```ts
const policy = resolveSlotPolicy({ cfg, slot, callSite: 'search', packShape: packShape(slot), calibrations, hasTypesafeKey });
if (policy.effective === 'off') return todaysPath();          // off, or on (inactive: reason)
const deadline = stageDeadlineMs(queryBudget, cfg.timeoutMs);
if (deadline === null) return todaysPath();                    // `late`
try {
  const r = await runDecide({ slot, callSite: 'search', state, questions, deadlineMs: deadline, provider: policy.provider }, { engine, config: cfg });
  if (driftReason(policy, r.model_resolved)) return todaysPath(); // model_drift receipt
  const outcomes = reduce(r.answers, policy);                  // shared reducer
  void writeReceipts(engine, { slot, mode: 'on', callSite: 'search', lane: 'hot', provider: policy.provider, policy, result: r, questions, state, outcomes });
  return apply(outcomes);
} catch (err) {
  return todaysPath();                                         // fail direction; error receipt
}
```

The same code runs on `typesafe:jev-1.13.0` and `llm:ollama:<model>`; only the
calibration row (keyed by provider and resolved model) differs.
