# Foundations 1 notes (`capy/foundations-1`, v0.60.37.0)

One integrated PR. Ten lanes (F0, F1a, F1b, F1c, F2, F3, F4a, F4b, F4c, F4d)
were built in parallel on the fix wave 8 collector (`capy/fix-wave-8`), merged
here in the order F1c (with F1a), F1b, F0, F3, F4a, F2, F4d, F4c, F4b, then
merged with master. Migrations were renumbered once at integration: v193
`f1_write_attribution`, v194 `f0_worktree_refreshes`, v195
`f3_access_token_grants`, v196 `f4_planner_stats` (PGLite only). Generated
files (schema blobs, migration registry, CLI flag registry, goldens, llms) were
regenerated, never hand-merged.

## Headline

10,000-page PGLite brain, as shipped with no manual ANALYZE
(`bun run test:scale -- --pages 10000 --seed 1`). Each cell is the median of
per-run p50s (five timed runs after a warmup in each harness run). All runs
were on one Ubicloud standard-8 VM, with the same fixture for every build:
five interleaved runs each for the last two columns and two runs for the
first.

| Metric | Fix wave 8 without #5932 | Fix wave 8 + #5932's ANALYZE fix (ad7252a) | Foundations 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `get_health` (memo off) | 12,073 ms | 208 ms | 158 ms |
| `find_orphans` | 14,989 ms | 43.5 ms | 34.3 ms |
| Keyword search scoped to one source | 38,645 ms | 18.2 ms | 22.1 ms |
| MCP search (headline) | 118 ms | 41.4 ms | 42.5 ms |
| `query` with injected vector (hybrid) | 306 ms | 375 ms | 26.3 ms |
| Import of 10,000 files | 119 s | 99 s | 62 s |
| Import rate ratio (last/first 10%) | 1.74 | 0.85 | 0.84 |
| Enforced gates | n/a (report-only build) | `planner_stats` fails | all pass |

Most of the drop from fix wave 8 comes from GBRA-39's full ANALYZE after bulk
writes (#5932, on master since v0.60.35.0; F4b carried it as the cherry-pick f1970519, which the master merge reconciles). Foundations adds what
keeps statistics fresh between syncs: import time falls from 99 s to 62 s, and
the hybrid query from 375 ms to 26 ms, because the vector arm uses its HNSW
index once statistics see the injected embeddings. Keyword search scoped to
one source moved from 18.2 to 22.1 ms; the run ranges overlap (17.4-19.4 vs
18.7-25.0 ms).

Two harness fixes came out of the enforced runs:

- With statistics, PGLite plans the vector arm on HNSW, and the fixture's
  two-hot vectors (almost every pair at the same distance) gave HNSW nothing
  to navigate. On one kept 10k brain the injected-vector probe found its page
  in 2 to 5 of 10 probes per index build, across 6 rebuilds, and one enforced
  run failed its hybrid known answer. Seeded dense vectors in 16 dimensions
  found 30 of 30 on each of 6 rebuilds (421836c2).
- `get_health` is timed with its memo off (fb7f3657); with the memo on, repeat
  calls return in about 0.3 ms and say nothing about the computation.

Integration-only fixes: the F0 refresh test passes an attribution to
`withCoordinatedWrite` (9a128ddd); `core-persistence.md` split under the 60 KB
key-files cap (49303357); the reindex perf fixture classifies a bare `ANALYZE`
as statistics (from #5932's 77dcf414, in 902f462e). The first GitHub scale-tier run crashed because its corpus lives under the repository's ignored `.context/`, which `gbrain import` listed as empty; import now walks an explicitly named ignored directory, and the harness validates a reused corpus file by file and refuses an empty or partly listed one with a named fix.

## Gates

- `bun run typecheck`, `bun run verify` (67 checks).
- `bun run ci:ubicloud`: gitleaks, unit, slow, serial, E2E (Postgres and
  PgBouncer), verify; all green at every integration push.
- OpenClaw native context-engine startup test against pgvector pg16
  (`test/openclaw-context-engine-native.serial.test.ts`, openclaw 2026.9.4),
  run locally because the Ubicloud gate does not include it.
- Enforced scale tier at 10k PGLite pages: 5 of 5 runs pass every enforced gate.
- gstack credential pre-push guard on every push: no HIGH findings.

Wave security scan (`bun run wave-security-scan origin/capy/fix-wave-8..HEAD`,
before the master merge): gitleaks 0 findings with the test/skills allowlist
stripped, no `admin/dist` change, no dependency change. The one obfuscation
alarm is benign: `test/write-attribution-legacy.test.ts` decodes a base64 PNG
fixture. The one "new" outbound URL is an existing link
(oven-sh/bun#30305) on a rewritten key-files line. New spawns are the scale
harness's own `gbrain import` and cold-query children and `gh` in
`scripts/scale/trend.ts`.
