# Takes vs Facts — Architectural Distinction

gbrain has two epistemological storage layers that serve different purposes.
**Never conflate them.**

## Takes (cold storage — `takes` table)

The epistemological layer. WHO believes WHAT, with confidence weight and time.

- **Source:** Extracted from brain pages (markdown) by LLM analysis
- **Scope:** Multi-holder — captures beliefs from *any* speaker, not just the brain owner
- **Kinds:** `take` (opinion), `fact` (verifiable), `bet` (prediction), `hunch` (intuition)
- **Lifecycle:** Cold storage, retrospective. Updated when pages change or re-extraction runs.
- **Scale:** 100K+ rows across thousands of holders in a mature brain

**Example takes:**
- `holder=people/alice-example kind=bet` "AI will replace 50% of coding by 2030" (w=0.75)
- `holder=people/bob-example kind=take` "widget-co has strong retention" (w=0.80)
- `holder=world kind=fact` "acme-example raised a Series C" (w=1.0)
- `holder=brain kind=hunch` "alice-example has a hero/rescuer pattern" (w=0.70)

**Query surface:** `gbrain takes list`, `gbrain takes search`, `gbrain takes search --semantic`, `gbrain think`

Take vectors (used by `takes search --semantic` and the `think` vector stream)
are kept current by `gbrain embed --stale`, which the cycle's embed phase runs:
it embeds every active take that has no vector, whose claim changed since it
was embedded, or whose vector came from another embedding model. Each vector
records the model and the claim text it was computed from. Takes on deleted
pages or archived sources are skipped. `gbrain takes embed` runs the same pass
on its own; `gbrain takes embed --dry-run` shows the pending provider work
without making calls.

To stop automatic take embedding, run `gbrain config set takes.auto_embed false`
(or set `GBRAIN_EMBED_TAKES=0` for one process; the variable wins over the
config key). `gbrain takes embed` keeps working when it is off.

`gbrain migrate embeddings` moves take vectors with the rest of the brain: the
plan counts stale takes, a width change resizes `takes.embedding`, the re-embed
drain refills it, and the run does not complete while takes are still stale.
`gbrain doctor` reports takes and facts without a current-model vector in the
`fact_take_vectors` check ([verification runbook](GBRAIN_VERIFY.md#5a-fact-and-take-vectors)).
Until take vectors exist, `think` falls back to keyword-only takes retrieval and
`takes search --semantic` simply reports no semantic matches.

## Facts (hot memory — `facts` table)

Personal knowledge from the brain owner's conversations. Real-time capture.

- **Source:** Extracted per-turn from conversation by the facts hook (Haiku)
- **Scope:** Single-user — only the brain owner's stated knowledge
- **Kinds:** `event`, `preference`, `commitment`, `belief`, `fact`, `idea`
  (`idea` is extractor/DB-only — the frozen `remember` verb enum stays at five,
  per `docs/protocol/MEMORY_VERBS_v1.md`)
- **Lifecycle:** Hot storage, real-time. Captured as conversations happen.
- **Bridge:** Dream cycle `consolidate` phase promotes hot facts → cold takes nightly

**Example facts:**
- `kind=event` "I have a meeting with alice-example tomorrow"
- `kind=preference` "I don't drink coffee"
- `kind=commitment` "We decided to move the offsite to March"
- `kind=belief` "I think the market is overheated"

**Query surface:** `gbrain recall`, MCP `_meta.brain_hot_memory`

## The Category Error

**Never dump takes into the facts table.** Takes include other people's attributed
beliefs (a partner's assessment of a company, an investor's view on markets, a
founder's revenue claims). These are NOT the brain owner's personal facts.

**Never dump facts into the takes table without transformation.** Facts are
scoped to what the owner said in conversation. They become takes only through
the dream cycle's consolidate phase, which adds proper attribution, deduplication,
and temporal reasoning.

## The Bridge

The dream cycle's `consolidate` phase is the one-way bridge:

```
hot facts → [dream consolidate] → cold takes
```

Facts flow in ONE direction. The consolidate phase:
1. Groups related facts by entity
2. Deduplicates against existing takes
3. Promotes durable facts to takes with proper holder/weight
4. Marks consolidated facts with `consolidated_at` + `consolidated_into`

## Production Extraction Data

Full takes extraction on a ~100K-page brain (measured 2026-05-10):
- **Model:** Azure GPT-5.5 (ties Opus quality at 1/8th cost — $0.033 vs $0.260/page)
- **Result:** 100,720 takes from 28,256 on-disk pages, $361.49, 83 errors (0.3%)
- **Breakdown:** 70,960 takes / 24,342 facts / 2,875 bets / 2,649 hunches
- **Holders:** 6,239 unique holders
- **Cross-modal eval:** 6.8/10 overall (GPT-5.5 + Opus 4.6 scored independently)

### Eval Dimensions

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Accuracy | 7.5 | Claims faithfully represent sources |
| Attribution | 6.5 | Holder/subject confusion is the top issue |
| Weight calibration | 7.0 | Good range usage, some false precision |
| Kind classification | 6.5 | Occasional fact/take misclassification |
| Signal density | 6.5 | Some trivial extractions pass through |

### Key Learnings for Extraction Prompts

1. **Holder ≠ subject.** "alice-example has a hero/rescuer pattern" → holder=brain, NOT people/alice-example
2. **Atomic claims.** Split compound claims into separate rows
3. **Amplification ≠ endorsement.** Retweet-only → max weight 0.55
4. **Self-reported ≠ verified.** "Reports 7 figures" → holder=person, weight=0.75, NOT world/1.0
5. **No false precision.** Use 0.05 increments (0.35, 0.55, 0.75), not 0.74 or 0.82
6. **"So what" test.** Skip Twitter handles, follower counts, obvious metadata

## Owner-holder canonicalization

"The brain owner" is, by convention, the holder string **`self`** — the value the
dream `consolidate` phase stamps when it promotes the owner's hot facts into cold
takes. Calibration, `think`, and the `doctor` calibration check resolve the owner
holder through `resolveOwnerHolder` (`src/core/owner-holder.ts`): explicit override
> `emotional_weight.user_holder` config > `self`.

Known limitation: the owner can also
appear under `brain` (a take the owner asserts, via `propose_takes`) and
`people/<owner>` (extraction that names the owner). The resolver selects the
*default* canonical owner string for reads; it does not merge those other
strings. Per-take attribution for other people (e.g. `people/bob-example`) is
unaffected and correct.
