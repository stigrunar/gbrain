# Life Chronicle: automatic timeline events

**Say to your agent:** *"What happened in my meetings last Tuesday?"*

**Say to your agent:** *"Turn off automatic event extraction."*

**Say to your agent:** *"Extract events from my older meeting notes."*

When you save a meeting, conversation or calendar page, gbrain turns it into
timeline events (`life/events/` pages plus a day-by-day projection) so
`gbrain day <date>`, `gbrain since <date>` and `gbrain on-this-day` can answer
"what happened". This runs automatically and is **on by default**. Each
eligible page costs one paid chat call, except an ended calendar invite, which
is projected without a model call (see [Calendar invites](#calendar-invites)).

To turn it off:

```bash
gbrain config set auto_chronicle false
```

Unsetting the key restores the default, which is on. Use `set ... false` to
opt out.

## What qualifies

A page is extracted automatically when all of these hold:

- Its type is `meeting`, `conversation` or `calendar-event`, or its slug starts
  with `meetings/`, `conversations/`, `cal/` or `calendar/`.
- Its body has at least 80 characters. Dream-generated pages, diary pages
  (`life/diary/`) and event pages themselves are never extracted.
- It was written or changed while automatic extraction was active on the brain
  (v0.60.45.0 or later). History is never swept automatically.
- Its own date (frontmatter `date`, `start` or an authored effective date) is
  within `chronicle.auto_recent_days` (default 30). Undated pages count as
  recent.
- A calendar invite has ended. An invite for next week is picked up once its
  end time passes, with no edit needed.
- The writer is not confined. Slug-bound, delegated or namespace-restricted
  clients, and grants without `extract_facts`, never trigger extraction.
- The sync did not run with `--no-extract`. A remote sync never extracts.

The page must also stay unchanged for `chronicle.auto_settle_seconds` (default
180) so a note written in several passes is extracted once.

## What becomes an event

An event is something the page records as having happened by the end of its
own day: the meeting or conversation itself, what was decided, said or agreed
in it, and earlier events the text dates. Plans, follow-ups, deadlines and
scheduled meetings are not events, even when the page gives them a date.

Two rules are enforced after the model answers, before anything is written:

- **No event after the page's own day.** The page's own day is the latest of
  its own date (frontmatter `date` or `start`, or an authored effective date),
  a calendar invite's `end`, and a conversation's last message, read in
  `chronicle.tz` (default UTC). Anything on that day counts. A proposed event
  dated later, or after today, is dropped as `future_dated`. "Board meeting in
  Austin on May 15" in an April 18 meeting note never becomes a May 15 event.
- **No invented days.** Events are stored by day. A past event the text dates
  only by year or month ("back in 2024", "last month") is dropped as
  `date_imprecise` rather than pinned to January 1 or the first of the month.

The phase result reports dropped proposals by reason in `events_dropped`. When
every proposed event of a page is dropped, its ledger row records that reason
instead of `no_events`.

## Calendar invites

A calendar invite is a page under `calendar/` or `cal/` (or of type
`calendar-event`) with a title and frontmatter `start` and `end`, the shape the
Google calendar import writes. Once its end time passes, the chronicle phase
turns it into one event without a chat call:

| Event field | Value |
|---|---|
| `what` and title | `Scheduled: <invite title>` |
| `when` | the invite's `start` |
| `who` | the invite's `attendees` |
| `where` | the invite's `location` |
| `kind` | `meeting` |
| `captured_via` | `life-chronicle:invite` |

An invite is not proof that you attended. The `Scheduled:` prefix and
`captured_via: life-chronicle:invite` say the meeting was on the calendar, not
that it happened; meeting notes under `meetings/` carry what happened. The
projection takes no daily-limit slot and records a zero cost; publication,
operator-edit protection and retirement work exactly as for judged events. A
calendar page without a title, `start` and `end` is judged like a meeting page.
The date rules above apply to projected invites too.

## Event pages

Each event is a `life/events/<day>-<hash>` page. `<day>` is the event's day in
the brain timezone (`chronicle.tz`, default UTC), and `<hash>` is derived from
who, what and the source page, so re-extracting the same content updates the
same page.

Two events of one page can share who, what and day, for example a morning and
an afternoon "Call with alice-example". Both are kept: one holds the bare slug
and the other gets `-<hash6>`, derived from its time, place and kind.
Byte-identical events get `-2`, `-3`. The assignment does not depend on the
order the model lists events: an event keeps the slug it already has across
reorderings and re-extractions, the earliest event takes a free bare slug, and
correcting one event moves only that event.

## Cost and limits

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `auto_chronicle` | on (unset) | `gbrain config set auto_chronicle false` turns automatic extraction off. |
| `chronicle.job_budget_usd` | `0.25` | Cap for one page's extraction call. This is a per-call cap, not a daily budget. |
| `chronicle.auto_daily_limit` | `200` | Automatic extraction calls per rolling 24 hours, across every writer. Retries count. |
| `chronicle.auto_recent_days` | `30` | How old a page's own date may be for automatic extraction. |
| `chronicle.auto_settle_seconds` | `180` | How long a page must stay unchanged before extraction. |
| `chronicle.judge_max_tokens` | `4000` | Output-token cap for one extraction call. |

`gbrain config set` refuses values outside each range and names the range. A
value already stored out of range falls back to its default, and doctor warns
(`chronicle_config_invalid`).

The worst case per day is `auto_daily_limit` x `job_budget_usd`, so $50 at the
defaults for a priced model. Typical pages cost far less. If gbrain has no price
for your chat model, the default cap cannot apply: extraction warns and runs,
still limited by the daily call count. If you set `chronicle.job_budget_usd`
yourself, an unpriced model refuses with `no_pricing`; register its price with
`gbrain pricing set` (see [spend controls](../operations/spend-controls.md)).

Page text is sent to the configured chat provider. Events derived from a private
page stay private to remote callers, including after the page is renamed or
purged.

## Check that it works

1. Write a meeting page. Its write receipt carries
   `chronicle_backstop: { "pending": "next_cycle", "daily_remaining": <n> }`.
   A skip carries `chronicle_backstop: { "skipped": "<code>", "why": ..., "fix": ... }`
   (codes below). Ordinary notes have no `chronicle_backstop` field.
2. Wait for the next autopilot cycle, or run the phase now (paid):
   ```bash
   gbrain dream --phase chronicle
   ```
   On PGLite this is how pending pages run when autopilot is not running.
3. Read the day back:
   ```bash
   gbrain day 2026-04-03
   ```

`gbrain doctor` reports the `auto_chronicle` check: whether it is on, 24 h use
of the daily limit and the largest writer's share, 7-day outcomes and spend
(priced dollars, unpriced calls and calls without a cost record are listed
apart), pending pages and the command that runs them.

## After upgrading

Automatic extraction is on by default from v0.60.45.0. On a brain upgraded
from an earlier release, doctor shows `auto_chronicle_default_on` (info) until
you answer, and the advisor shows the same finding with `ask_user: true`. The agent relays the cost to you, then records
your answer:

```bash
gbrain config set auto_chronicle true    # keep it
gbrain config set auto_chronicle false   # opt out
```

A brain that already had `auto_chronicle true` sees the notice too, because
that setting had no effect before v0.60.45.0.

An upgrade that changes how events are extracted raises the extractor version,
which makes already-extracted pages new to the ledger. On an unmanaged brain,
the phase re-extracts recent pages changed since activation, under the daily
limit. A managed brain records `no_write_decision` for them, and backfill
re-extracts them on request. Ended calendar invites re-project without a call.
Re-extraction keeps each existing event's slug.

## History: backfill on request

Older pages are extracted only when you ask. Backfill is paid, so preview it
first and agree to the cost:

```bash
gbrain chronicle-backfill --since 2026-09-01 --limit 50 --dry-run
gbrain chronicle-backfill --since 2026-09-01 --limit 50 --yes
```

`--since` filters on the page's last update, not its own date. Re-running is
safe: content already extracted is not paid for again.

## Skip and failure codes

Write receipts, doctor and the advisor use these codes. `decision` codes come
from the write; `execution` codes come from the chronicle phase. Values in angle
brackets are filled in with real values on each surface.

| `date_imprecise` | execution | Every event the extraction proposed had only a year or a month ("back in 2024"), so none was written; the timeline stores days and never invents one. | — | — | — |

<!-- chronicle-reasons:end -->

Don't hand-write `life/events/` pages: extraction owns them and retires events
the page no longer supports. Edit the meeting page instead.
