# Facts and takes fence format

A page keeps its structured rows in two kinds of fenced Markdown tables: a
**facts** fence (what is true about the page's subject) and a **takes** fence
(who believes what, and how strongly). This page is the exact format gbrain
accepts, what it fixes in a malformed fence by itself, and what it never
guesses. Everything between the generated markers below is rendered from the
parser and repair code, so it matches the running gbrain.

**Say to your agent:** *"Why was my facts table held? Show me what the fence
should look like."*

**Say to your agent:** *"Add this as a take held by alice-example, not by hand
in the table."*

Prefer the structured writers to hand-written tables: `remember` adds a fact
row and `takes_add` adds a take row, each with a valid row number, kind and
holder, so the fence never needs repair. Write a table by hand only when the
user asks for it, and follow the format below.

When a fence does not follow this format, gbrain fixes what has one exact
meaning in the same write and holds or refuses the rest with an
`invalid_fence` reason ([what each reason means](write-refusals.md#invalid_fence)).
On the brain host, `gbrain repair fences` previews and applies the remaining
repairs, and the maintenance run applies them automatically
([fence repair](repair.md#fences)).

<a id="markers"></a>
## Markers

A facts fence sits between `<!--- gbrain:facts:begin -->` and `<!--- gbrain:facts:end -->`; a takes fence between `<!--- gbrain:takes:begin -->` and `<!--- gbrain:takes:end -->` (three dashes after `<!`). The body and the timeline section of a page each hold at most one fence of each kind. A marker inside a code block or an inline code span is an example, not a fence. Inside the fence the first table line is the header, which names `claim` and `kind`, then a separator line, then one line per row. A `|` inside a cell is written `\|`.

<a id="facts-columns"></a>
## Facts columns

Facts cells are read by position.

| Position | Column | Values | May be left off the row end | Default when the header lacks it | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `#` | a positive whole number | no | - | Row number. |
| 2 | `claim` | free text | no | - | The statement, free text. `~~claim~~` marks a row that is no longer active. |
| 3 | `kind` | `event`, `preference`, `commitment`, `belief`, `fact`, `idea` | no | - | What the claim is. |
| 4 | `confidence` | a number from 0 to 1 | no | `1.0` | How sure the brain is. |
| 5 | `visibility` | `private`, `world` | no | `private` | Who may read the row. |
| 6 | `notability` | `high`, `medium`, `low` | no | `medium` | How much it matters. |
| 7 | `valid_from` | free text | no | - | When it became true (`YYYY-MM-DD`), or empty. |
| 8 | `valid_until` | free text | no | - | When it stopped being true, or empty. |
| 9 | `source` | free text | no | - | Where it came from, free text. |
| 10 | `context` | free text | yes | - | Free text. `superseded by #N` names the row that replaced a struck row; `forgotten: ...` marks a row withdrawn with `forget`. |
| 11 | `claim_metric` | free text | yes | - | Metric of a typed claim (`mrr`, `team_size`, ...), or empty. |
| 12 | `claim_value` | a number, optionally with 1,234 separators or a k/M/B suffix | yes | - | Value of a typed claim. |
| 13 | `claim_unit` | free text | yes | - | Unit (`USD`, `people`, ...), or empty. |
| 14 | `claim_period` | free text | yes | - | Period (`monthly`, `annual`, ...), or empty. |

<a id="facts-layouts"></a>
- **Narrow, 10 cells** (what gbrain writes unless a row needs a wide column):

  ```text
  | # | claim | kind | confidence | visibility | notability | valid_from | valid_until | source | context |
  |---|-------|------|------------|------------|------------|------------|-------------|--------|---------|
  ```

- **Wide, 14 cells** (adds `claim_metric`, `claim_value`, `claim_unit`, `claim_period`):

  ```text
  | # | claim | kind | confidence | visibility | notability | valid_from | valid_until | source | context | claim_metric | claim_value | claim_unit | claim_period |
  |---|-------|------|------------|------------|------------|------------|-------------|--------|---------|--------------|-------------|------------|--------------|
  ```

- **Shortest row, 9 cells:** the narrow row without `context`. A row that is short anywhere else is `short_row`.

<a id="takes-columns"></a>
## Takes columns

Takes cells are read by position, except `resolved`, `quality`, `evidence`, `value`, `unit`, `by`, which are read by header name.

| Position | Column | Values | May be left off the row end | Default when the header lacks it | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `#` | a positive whole number | no | - | Row number. |
| 2 | `claim` | free text | no | - | The position, free text. `~~claim~~` marks a row that is no longer active. |
| 3 | `kind` | `fact`, `take`, `bet`, `hunch` | no | - | What the take is. |
| 4 | `who` | `world`, `brain`, `people/<slug>`, `companies/<slug>` | no | - | Who holds the position (see [holders](#holders)): who said or clearly implied it, not who it is about. |
| 5 | `weight` | a number from 0 to 1 | no | - | How strongly it is held; stored on the 0.05 grid. There is no default. |
| 6 | `since` | free text | no | - | When the holder took the position (`YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM`; `start → end` for a range). |
| 7 | `source` | free text | yes | - | Where it came from. `superseded by #N` names the row that replaced a struck row. |
| 8 | `resolved` | free text | yes | - | When the take was resolved. Read by header name. |
| 9 | `quality` | free text | yes | - | How the take turned out. Read by header name. |
| 10 | `evidence` | free text | yes | - | What resolved it. Read by header name. |
| 11 | `value` | free text | yes | - | Resolved value. Read by header name. |
| 12 | `unit` | free text | yes | - | Unit of the resolved value. Read by header name. |
| 13 | `by` | free text | yes | - | Who resolved it. Read by header name. |

<a id="takes-layouts"></a>
- **Narrow, 7 cells** (what gbrain writes unless a row needs a wide column):

  ```text
  | # | claim | kind | who | weight | since | source |
  |---|-------|------|-----|--------|-------|--------|
  ```

- **Wide, 13 cells** (adds `resolved`, `quality`, `evidence`, `value`, `unit`, `by`):

  ```text
  | # | claim | kind | who | weight | since | source | resolved | quality | evidence | value | unit | by |
  |---|-------|------|-----|--------|-------|--------|----------|---------|----------|-------|------|----|
  ```

- **Shortest row, 6 cells:** the narrow row without `source`. A row that is short anywhere else is `short_row`.

<a id="holders"></a>
## Holders

A takes `who` cell is one of `world`, `brain`, `people/<slug>`, `companies/<slug>`. Slugs are lowercase.

| Written | Valid | What gbrain does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `world` | yes | Accepted. |
| `brain` | yes | Accepted. |
| `people/alice-example` | yes | Accepted. |
| `companies/acme-example` | yes | Accepted. |
| `alice-example` | yes | Accepted (an older bare-slug form); write `people/<slug>` or `companies/<slug>` instead. |
| `System` | no | Rewritten to `brain` (`holder_alias`). |
| `Alice Example` | no | Not a holder: `holder_unresolved`. Tier 2 resolves it only to one verified page; otherwise a person fixes it. |
| `people/Alice-Example` | no | Not a holder: `holder_unresolved`. Tier 2 resolves it only to one verified page; otherwise a person fixes it. |
| `world/alice-example` | no | Not a holder: `holder_unresolved`. Tier 2 resolves it only to one verified page; otherwise a person fixes it. |
| `users/alice-example` | no | Not a holder: `holder_unresolved`. Tier 2 resolves it only to one verified page; otherwise a person fixes it. |

<a id="row-numbers"></a>
## Row numbers

- `#` is a positive whole number, unique per fence kind across the whole page: the body and the timeline count together.
- A struck row keeps its number, and `superseded by #N` must name a row on the page.
- gbrain renumbers a row whose number is zero, negative, not a number or a duplicate. When two rows share a number, the row that matches the stored row keeps it. A new number is one above every number on the page (live and struck, both sections) and every stored row number of the page, so a freed number is not reused. A number whose only trace was deleted before this release is not known and could be reused.
- gbrain does not renumber a duplicate that a `superseded by #N` reference names (`superseded_ambiguous`), or rows hidden from a remote caller.

<a id="examples"></a>
## Examples

A valid facts fence (narrow layout; row 2 was superseded by row 3):

```markdown
<!--- gbrain:facts:begin -->
| # | claim | kind | confidence | visibility | notability | valid_from | valid_until | source | context |
|---|-------|------|------------|------------|------------|------------|-------------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Acme Example plans to open its widget API in 2026 | event | 0.9 | private | high | 2026-03-01 |  | meetings/2026-04-03 |  |
| 2 | ~~Acme Example has 12 engineers~~ | fact | 1.0 | private | medium | 2025-06-01 | 2026-01-15 | companies/acme-example | superseded by #3 |
| 3 | Acme Example has 18 engineers | fact | 1.0 | private | medium | 2026-01-15 |  | companies/acme-example |  |
<!--- gbrain:facts:end -->
```

A valid takes fence (narrow layout):

```markdown
<!--- gbrain:takes:begin -->
| # | claim | kind | who | weight | since | source |
|---|-------|------|-----|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Acme Example reaches profitability in 2027 | bet | people/alice-example | 0.65 | 2026-04 | meetings/2026-04-03 |
| 2 | Widget pricing drives most churn | take | brain | 0.55 | 2026-04 |  |
| 3 | Acme Example sells developer tools | fact | world | 1.0 | 2026-01 | companies/acme-example |
<!--- gbrain:takes:end -->
```

<a id="normalized"></a>
## What gbrain fixes by itself

These rules run on every write path for free. They edit or move cell text and never re-render a table. A fence they fix completely is written back in fixed form; each fix is reported by its class, row and column.

| Class | What it rewrites |
| --- | --- |
| `close_fence` | A fence with no end marker gets one directly after its table, when nothing but blank lines follows the last row up to the end of the section. |
| `marker_form` | Two-dash takes markers (`<!-- gbrain:takes:begin -->`) directly above a takes table become the three-dash markers. Two-dash facts markers are not a fence and are left alone. |
| `stray_empty_cell` | A row with more cells than its header (with no header: than the narrow layout, or 14 facts cells) loses empty cells, only when exactly one choice of empty cells to remove leaves every checked column (`#`, kind, confidence, visibility, notability, `claim_value`; takes kind, holder, weight) valid. Otherwise the row is `extra_cells` and a person fixes it. |
| `renumber` | A row number that is zero, negative, not a number or a duplicate gets a new number (see [row numbers](#row-numbers)). |
| `column_default` | A required facts column missing from the whole header gets its write default: `confidence` `1.0`, `notability` `medium`, `visibility` `private`. Takes have no defaults; a takes fence with no weight is `weight_missing`. |
| `header_alias` | A header whose every column has a known spelling (see [header spellings](#header-spellings)) becomes the canonical header, and each row's cells move into canonical order unchanged. |
| `enum_synonym` | Facts notability `critical`, `very high`, `highest` → `high`; `very low`, `minor` → `low`; visibility `internal`, `team`, `confidential`, `restricted`, `secret`, `shared` → `private`, and `public` → `world` only on a world-visible page (`private` otherwise); case and spacing variants of a canonical value. Any other word is `enum_unmapped`. |
| `kind_map` | Facts: `proposal`, `suggestion`, `hypothesis` → `idea`; `opinion`, `view`, `insight`, `assessment`, `frame` → `belief`; `promise`, `pledge` → `commitment`; `meeting`, `launch`, `announcement`, `milestone` → `event`; any other word → `fact`, with the word kept in `context` (for example `original kind: partnership`). A facts kind cell longer than three words, or with sentence punctuation, a link or strikethrough, is not read as a kind: it is `claim_split`, usually the end of a claim an unescaped `|` cut in two. Takes: `assessment`, `recommendation`, `strategic position`, `opinion`, `view` → `take`; `prediction`, `forecast` → `bet`; `guess`, `intuition` → `hunch`; any other word is `takes_kind_unsupported`, because gbrain never chooses a takes kind. |
| `holder_alias` | Takes holder `system`, `assistant`, `ai`, `agent`, `gbrain`, `model` (any case) → `brain`. |
| `confidence_format` | A percent or a number with stray spaces in `confidence` or `weight` becomes a decimal: `85%` → `0.85`, `0. 8` → `0.8`. A number outside 0 to 1 is `confidence_out_of_range`. |
| `holder_verified` | Tier 2, not Tier 1: a takes holder written as a name becomes the one `people/` or `companies/` page it resolves to exactly. On a world-visible page a private page never matches. Anything less certain stays `holder_unresolved`. |

<a id="header-spellings"></a>
### Header spellings

Header cells are compared case-insensitively, with spaces, `_` and `-` treated alike. A column not listed accepts only its own name.

| facts column | Also accepted in a header |
| --- | --- |
| `#` | `row`, `row #`, `row num`, `row number`, `no`, `no.`, `num` |
| `claim` | `fact`, `statement` |
| `kind` | `type`, `category` |
| `confidence` | `conf`, `weight` |
| `visibility` | `vis` |
| `notability` | `importance` |
| `valid_from` | `valid from`, `since`, `date`, `from` |
| `valid_until` | `valid until`, `until`, `to` |
| `source` | `src` |
| `context` | `notes`, `note` |
| `claim_metric` | `claim metric`, `metric` |
| `claim_value` | `claim value`, `value` |
| `claim_unit` | `claim unit`, `unit` |
| `claim_period` | `claim period`, `period` |

| takes column | Also accepted in a header |
| --- | --- |
| `#` | `row`, `row #`, `row num`, `row number`, `no`, `no.`, `num` |
| `claim` | `take`, `statement` |
| `kind` | `type` |
| `who` | `holder` |
| `weight` | `confidence`, `conf` |
| `since` | `date`, `as of` |
| `source` | `src` |

<a id="never-guessed"></a>
## What gbrain never guesses

A problem the rules above cannot fix exactly is held or refused with a reason. The reason says which tier clears it:

- **llm** (Tier 3, the repair model rewrites only the named rows, or answers HOLD when a row has two readings): [`header_unmapped`](write-refusals.md#fence-header_unmapped), [`no_header`](write-refusals.md#fence-no_header), [`row_before_header`](write-refusals.md#fence-row_before_header), [`short_row`](write-refusals.md#fence-short_row).
- **resolver** (Tier 2, verified holder lookup, free): [`holder_unresolved`](write-refusals.md#fence-holder_unresolved).
- **manual** (a person edits the fence; gbrain never guesses): [`extra_cells`](write-refusals.md#fence-extra_cells), [`claim_split`](write-refusals.md#fence-claim_split), [`missing_begin`](write-refusals.md#fence-missing_begin), [`split_rows`](write-refusals.md#fence-split_rows), [`unclosed_trailing_content`](write-refusals.md#fence-unclosed_trailing_content), [`marker_near_miss`](write-refusals.md#fence-marker_near_miss), [`repeated_marker`](write-refusals.md#fence-repeated_marker), [`takes_in_facts`](write-refusals.md#fence-takes_in_facts), [`superseded_ambiguous`](write-refusals.md#fence-superseded_ambiguous), [`enum_unmapped`](write-refusals.md#fence-enum_unmapped), [`weight_missing`](write-refusals.md#fence-weight_missing), [`holder_missing`](write-refusals.md#fence-holder_missing), [`confidence_out_of_range`](write-refusals.md#fence-confidence_out_of_range), [`claim_value_invalid`](write-refusals.md#fence-claim_value_invalid), [`takes_kind_unsupported`](write-refusals.md#fence-takes_kind_unsupported).

<a id="gates"></a>
### Gates every repair passes

No tier writes a fence until all of these hold, and the result is one the rules above would leave unchanged. A Tier 3 proposal that fails one stays held with the gate and rows named.

| Gate | Reason when it fails | What must hold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (a) | [`still_invalid`](write-refusals.md#fence-still_invalid) | The result parses with no warning: no repeated marker, unique row numbers. |
| (b) | [`claim_changed`](write-refusals.md#fence-claim_changed) | Every claim cell is unchanged (struck claims included). |
| (c) | [`row_number_changed`](write-refusals.md#fence-row_number_changed) | Every row number that was valid and unique still names the same claim. |
| (d) | [`visibility_loosened`](write-refusals.md#fence-visibility_loosened) | No row becomes more visible: `private` never turns `world`. |
| (e) | [`row_count_changed`](write-refusals.md#fence-row_count_changed) | No row is added or dropped, and every row of the fence stays inside it. |
| (f) | [`cell_changed`](write-refusals.md#fence-cell_changed) | A cell valid in its column keeps its text; a misaligned cell may only move, and text changes only through a named rule. |
| (g) | [`protection_loosened`](write-refusals.md#fence-protection_loosened) | Text the privacy boundary hid before the repair stays hidden after it. |
