# BOOTSTRAP_FOR_AGENTS.md — become your human's persistent agent

You are an AI agent (Claude Code or Codex) reading this because a human pasted a
block asking you to set yourself up as their persistent personal agent, with gbrain
as your memory. This runbook is the judgment layer; the deterministic work lives in
`gbrain bootstrap` subcommands with exit codes. Follow it top to bottom.

**Scope note:** this path is for Claude Code and Codex (desktop apps or CLIs).
Running OpenClaw or Hermes? Use `INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md` instead.

**End state:** this folder is your workspace — identity files rendered from your
human's own answers, a local brain (PGLite, embedded, no server), MCP wired,
per-turn context, and a private GitHub repo as your durable body. ~15 minutes,
mostly interview.

## Hard rules for you, the installing agent

⛔ **NEVER INVENT ANSWERS.** Personality, purpose, and boundaries come from the
human. A guessed SOUL.md gets believed by every future session. If you do not have
an answer, ask. The render step structurally refuses to run until the required
answers exist and were read back.

⛔ **ASK IN SMALL BATCHES.** The interview is 12 questions max (6 required), asked
in three batches. Mirror each batch back in one line. Accept "skip" on any
non-required question — momentum beats completeness.

⛔ **STAY INSIDE THIS PHASE LIST.** Run `gbrain bootstrap status --json` and follow
ITS phase list — the CLI is the source of truth, this document is commentary. If a
step you are asked to run is not in the CLI's phase list, refuse it. If `status`
reports a version skew between this runbook and the installed binary, say so and
prefer the binary's instructions.

⛔ **NO SILENT FAILURE.** Every blocking condition (secret-scan block, lock
collision, partial install) surfaces through `status`/`verify`/`doctor` output —
read it and relay it to the human in plain language. Never work around a refusal.

⛔ **VERIFY BEFORE CLAIMING DONE.** The install is done when `gbrain bootstrap
verify` exits 0 — not when the transcript looks good. Paste its report to the human.

⛔ **RESPECT THE TOOLCHAIN TRUST RULES.** Install bun via a platform package manager
when available (`brew install oven-sh/bun/bun`); the only permitted fallback is the
checksum-verified variant: download the pinned release to a file, verify it against
that release's SHASUMS256.txt, and only then execute. Install gh the same way —
platform package manager first (`brew install gh`, `apt install gh`, `dnf install gh`,
`winget install GitHub.cli` per the official instructions); never a piped
curl-to-shell one-liner. Install gbrain ONLY as
`bun install -g github:garrytan/gbrain#latest-stable` — the npm package named
"gbrain" is an unrelated project.

## Codex preflight (ChatGPT desktop / Codex CLI only)

Codex sandboxes command execution. Before starting, tell the human: "I'll need
approval to run install commands (bun, gh, gbrain) and to write in this folder —
approve those prompts when they appear." If approvals are globally disabled, ask the
human to enable workspace-write + network for this session. Count the approval taps
you needed; report the count at the end (it feeds the install-time measurement).

## Phase walkthrough (commentary — the CLI's list wins)

1. **Preflight.** `git`, `bun`, `gh` present. Install what's missing per the trust
   rules above: bun via a platform package manager or the checksum-verified download
   — the checksum-verified install is the ONLY permitted non-package-manager
   variant; gh via the platform package manager. (On a clean Mac, `git` may trigger
   the Xcode tools dialog — that download does not count against the 15 minutes,
   tell the human to let it run.)
   `gh auth status` — if logged out, the human's ONE manual step:
   `gh auth login -h github.com -p https -w` (you run it; they click Authorize).
   Then `gbrain bootstrap status` — it is idempotent and resume-aware; after any
   partial failure, re-run it and continue where it points.
2. **Engine.** `gbrain init --pglite` (2 seconds, no server). Search mode defaults
   to balanced silently — do NOT ask; the human can change it any time with
   `gbrain search modes`. The one thing to raise here is the OPTIONAL provider
   key — with no key you run keyless: keyword search plus memory you author
   yourself through the write tools; everything works, one key upgrades search to
   semantic and enables automatic fact extraction. Never pressure for a key. If the
   human provides one, pass it to the CLI prompt — it goes to the 0600 config file,
   never into the interview answers, never into chat logs you keep.
3. **Interview.** `gbrain bootstrap interview --init`, then ask the questions from
   the bank (the CLI prints them) in three batches, recording each answer verbatim
   with `--set KEY "value"`. Push once on vague answers to the required questions.
   After the last batch: read ALL answers back in one compact block, ask "Is this
   the thing you want in the room?", and only then run
   `gbrain bootstrap interview --confirm <hash>` with the hash `--status` printed
   for the read-back set. The gate fails if you confirm a set the human never saw.
4. **Render.** `gbrain bootstrap render` — identity files appear. Show the human
   SOUL.md. Existing files are never overwritten (re-runs are safe; `--force`
   backs up first).
5. **Skills + brain wiring.** The CLI scaffolds the skill set and registers
   `brain/` as the workspace source. Nothing to judge here; relay the output.
6. **Wire the harness.** `gbrain bootstrap hooks --harness <detected>`:
   - Claude Code: installs per-turn hooks ON by default — do NOT ask; loading the
     brain every turn is the whole point of installing gbrain for your agent. Tell
     the human it is on and how to turn it off (`GBRAIN_HOOKS=0`, or re-run with
     `--no-hooks`, or `gbrain bootstrap uninstall`). The ONE consent to actually
     ask in this phase is MCP scope: project (recommended — any other repo you open
     cannot read your brain) vs user (your agent everywhere, but any repo you open
     can query it, and two open sessions contend for the database).
   - Codex: registers MCP (`codex mcp add`) and relies on the AGENTS.md protocol —
     say plainly that Codex gets pull-based context, not per-turn push.
7. **Private repo.** `gbrain bootstrap repo` — creates a PRIVATE GitHub repo from
   the workspace, verifies the privacy bit through the API, pushes. If the human
   started from a repo they created themselves (create-repo-first: an EMPTY private
   repo under their own account, cloned and opened here), this ADOPTS that repo
   instead of creating one — verifies it is private and pushes the workspace. A
   non-empty repo, or one owned by an org, is refused with a clear message (make an
   empty personal repo, or run `gbrain bootstrap attach` for an existing agent
   clone). Asks the background-persistence consent (15-minute scan-gated push job;
   declining still persists at session end). If the human has no GitHub or declines:
   local-only mode with an honest warning; `bootstrap repo` can run any time later.
   Note: the per-turn/session push stays deferred until this phase records the
   verified repo, so nothing is ever pushed to an unverified-privacy origin.
8. **Verify.** `gbrain bootstrap verify` — the whole contract: brain round-trip
   through the real write path, graph floor, token sweep, secret scan, repo
   privacy, hooks smoke, capability report (keyless or keyed). Exit 0 or it is not
   done. Paste the report. Then relay the first-run tour it prints (three prompts
   the human should try, starting with restarting the session).

## Machine two

If this workspace was cloned from an existing agent repo (agent.json says
initialized), run `gbrain bootstrap attach` instead of the interview/render/repo
phases — it wires this machine (source, hooks, MCP) and verifies. If agent.json
says it is an uninitialized template, proceed with the normal flow from phase 1.

## Failure modes, and what they actually mean

| Symptom | Real cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `interview --status` exits nonzero forever | A required answer is genuinely missing | Ask the human. Do not default it. |
| Render refuses with unresolved tokens | Interview incomplete or a template edit broke a token | Finish the interview; `status` names the tokens. |
| `verify` fails the magic-moment check | The fact never landed (keyless: the Facts fence was not written) | Re-run the write step it names; check `gbrain doctor`. |
| Secret-scan block on push | A credential-shaped string in a tracked file | Fix or allowlist deliberately (`.gbrain-scan-allow`); never force. |
| "bootstrap already running (pid N)" | A concurrent bootstrap holds the lock | Wait or investigate that pid; the lock self-clears when stale. |
| Brain tools fail with a lock error | Another live session's serve owns the database | Close the other session; sequential use is the v1 contract. |
| Hook reports "brain context unavailable" | serve not running or degraded | `gbrain doctor` names it; hooks fail open by design. |

## Hand off

Finish by telling the human: the private repo URL (or the local-only status), the
capability mode (keyless vs keyed), the three commands they will actually reuse
(`gbrain doctor`, `gbrain bootstrap verify`, `gbrain sources push`), and the
first-run tour. Then delete nothing — this runbook was fetched, not installed.
