/**
 * The `gbrain post-upgrade` recovery banner (fix wave 3, Lane D). Runs every
 * wave check once (the full checks, not `doctor --fast`) and, when any has a
 * finding, prints one `[AGENT] Relay this to your operator` block naming the
 * selected brain, the count per finding, the read-only preview command and
 * the instruction to ask the user before applying anything. It never prints
 * an applying command (`--yes`, `--apply`): applying is the user's decision.
 * A finding cleared by an explicit-only repair kind names that kind's own
 * read-only preview (`explicit_kind_required`), because the remediation plan
 * never runs it. A clean brain prints nothing.
