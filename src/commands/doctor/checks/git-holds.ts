 * host-only, so paths never reach a remote caller), and each source's next
 * step from the hold router (D6: the frontmatter repair preview, the fence
 * repair preview, or both); fails once a source carries more holds than
 * `sync.hold_escalate_count`, the same count rule that escalates a sync result.
 * Unsupported-image holds (#5493) are listed but never escalate. With fence
 * holds, details carry `fences` and `auto_repair` (whether the maintenance run
 * repairs them by itself), which the post-upgrade banner reads.
