/**
 * The canonical fence reason table (#6188, D13). One entry per reason that a
 * fence refusal, hold or repair outcome can carry: where it arises, which
 * tier clears it, whether the maintenance pass retries it without a person,
 * who acts, the docs anchor and a location-only fix template. The error
 * registry's `invalid_fence.reasons` and the write-refusals anchors are
 * generated from this table.
 *
 * Fix templates take only location placeholders: `{fence}`, `{section}`,
 * `{rows}`, `{columns}`, `{line}` and `{allowed}` (schema vocabulary). They
 * never quote a cell.
