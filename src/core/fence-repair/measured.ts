/**
 * What the Tier 3 fence-repair eval measured (#6188 T4,
 * evals/fence-repair-tier3/; verdicts in gbrain-evals). The next eval run
 * updates both constants together.
 *
 * `FENCE_REPAIR_MEASURED_MODELS`: the models that met the preregistered
 * rule (gate-pass at least 80%, false accepts at most 1%) on both the round 1
 * fixtures and the held-out set (round 2, prompt v2), best first by held-out
 * gate-pass with ties to the cheaper model. With
 * `models.fence_repair` unset, model repair uses the first one the brain has
 * a provider key for; with none, model repair stays off by default
 * (`no_measured_model`). An explicit `models.fence_repair` always runs.
 *
 * `FENCE_REPAIR_MEASURED`: the sentence the behavior-change notice prints
 * about how often the model's rewrites are accepted. HTTP clients see it too,
 * so it names no model or provider (`gbrain models` names the model).
