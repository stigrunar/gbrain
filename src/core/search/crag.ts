/**
 * #1663 — CRAG-style retrieval-confidence gate (the ceiling half of the
 * floor/ceiling redesign).
 *
 * Corrective-RAG's core move: GRADE what retrieval returned before acting on
 * it, and escalate when the evidence is weak instead of confidently handing
 * the caller noise. gbrain's grade is zero-LLM — it reads the honesty
 * signals the pipeline already stamps (T4 evidence, the reranker's
 * cross-encoder score, the autocut weak-top floor):
 *
 *   strong   — rank-1 carries identity/vector evidence (alias_hit,
 *              exact_lookup, exact_title_match, high_vector_match) or the
 *              reranker scored the top at/above the weak-top floor.
 *   moderate — lexically verified top (keyword_exact) but no identity or
 *              calibrated-semantic signal; or an OR-relaxed keyword top whose
 *              evidence is corroborated (see `relaxedTopCorroborated`).
 *   weak     — zero results, a reranked top BELOW the weak-top floor
 *              (the #1863 "whole list is low-confidence" shape), an
 *              uncorroborated OR-relaxed keyword top (keyword_relaxed), or an
 *              unverified weak_semantic top.
 *
 * Consumers: the `query` op attaches the grade (+ query shape) to its
 * retrieval response meta on every call, and — config-gated, default OFF —
 * escalates a weak result once:
 *
 *   search.crag_escalation=true  → one high-ceiling retrieval re-run
 *                                  (expansion + relational + wide limit,
 *                                  autocut off) — keep whichever run grades
 *                                  better.
 *   search.crag_think=true       → still-weak + local caller → run `think`
 *                                  (multi-round gather + synthesis) and
 *                                  attach its answer to the response meta.
 *
 * Pure module: no engine access here — grading reads stamped fields only,
 * so it can never add latency or fail the search path.

/**
 * An OR-relaxed keyword top means no single chunk matched every query term.

 *
 *   - the question uses a word the corpus never writes ("Which CITY is Acme
 *     Example headquartered in?" against "Acme Example is headquartered in
 *     ..."), while the rest of the question is matched by one chunk; or
 *   - the asked-about thing is not in the evidence: the entity is matched in
 *     one chunk and the attribute only in others (a missing attribute), or
 *     a name in the question appears nowhere (an absent entity).
 *
 * Corroborated (graded moderate, not weak) when, over the top
 * RELAXED_CORROBORATION_DEPTH rows, all of these hold:
 *
 *   1. at most one query content term appears in none of the rows;
 *   2. that unmatched term is not a name term (an unmatched name means the
 *      question is about something the evidence does not mention);
 *   3. one row (title plus chunk text) contains every query term matched
 *      anywhere in the window, and at least two of them, so the matched
 *      evidence sits together instead of being split across pages.
 *
 * Purely lexical by design: relaxed rows only reach fusion when every vector
 * list is empty, so no cosine or rerank score exists on this path. A
 * question whose attribute is phrased with words the evidence never uses
 * ("annual recurring revenue" against "ARR") stays weak: lexically it is
 * indistinguishable from the attribute being absent.
