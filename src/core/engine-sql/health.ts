/**
 * Health: `getHealth` once for both engines (FOUNDATIONS 1, F4a).
 *
 * Three statements, no per-page rows returned to TypeScript:
 *   1. counters: page, chunk and link counts, embedding coverage, missing
 *      embeddings, dead links, entity link/timeline coverage;
 *   2. the linkable scope (live, unquarantined pages the shared orphan policy
 *      keeps, rendered in SQL by `orphanExclusionSql`) grouped by page type,
 *      with islanded and with-timeline counts per type. The brain_score
 *      timeline component's pack-aware grading (#5828) applies per type here;
 *   3. `most_connected`: in-scope link endpoints grouped per entity page.
 * Statement 2 is separate because, folded into statement 1, the combined
 * plan cost crosses Postgres's JIT thresholds on a 20k-page brain and JIT
 * compilation alone costs more than the query.
 *
 * Planner robustness: PGLite has no autovacuum, so a brain can be queried
 * before its first ANALYZE. Without statistics the planner underestimates
 * every filtered relation and picks nested loops that re-scan a subquery or
 * materialized set per outer row. The per-page and per-link checks that
 * were exposed to that (linkable flags, entity link coverage, endpoint scope
 * in `most_connected`, the chunk-to-page lookup) are written as primary-key
 * lookups the planner cannot reorder: scalar subqueries, or a LATERAL
 * subquery fenced with OFFSET 0. They stay linear with or without statistics.
 *
 * Scope (#4592): `sourceIds` > `sourceId` > brain-wide; duplicate ids count
 * once. Every count, coverage numerator and denominator, degree and the
 * islanded predicate confine to the scope; a link contributes only when both
 * endpoints are in scope, so a granted-to-ungranted edge never leaks the far
 * side through a degree or rescues a page from orphan-hood. Page-scoped
 * counts exclude soft-deleted pages (#1305); chunk and link counts stay raw,
 * matching getStats. Endpoint liveness (gbrain#4153): an inbound link counts
 * only when its source page is live, an outbound link only when its target
 * is. Quarantined pages (#4280) leave the entity denominators and the
 * linkable scope; machine leaf types leave the linkable scope through the
 * policy.
 *
 * Both engines ran these reads on the pool with no scope transaction, so the
 * statements take `LegacyUnscopedRead`.
