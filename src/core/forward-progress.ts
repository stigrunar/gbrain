/**
 * Process-wide forward-progress signal.
 *
 * A long-running command proves it is still doing useful work by calling
 * `noteForwardProgress()` whenever a unit of work completes (the shared
 * progress reporter calls it on every `tick`). Deadlines that must never kill
 * a run that is still progressing (the sync hard deadline, the serve boot
 * deadline) subscribe with `onForwardProgress` and extend themselves while
 * the signal keeps arriving. Heartbeats are NOT progress: a timer firing says
 * the event loop is alive, not that work is finishing.
 *
 * Zero imports on purpose: `progress.ts` (zero-dependency) and the watchdogs
 * both depend on it.
