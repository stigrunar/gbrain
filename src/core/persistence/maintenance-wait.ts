 * #5854: how long a maintenance publisher waits for its accepted write to
 * commit before the receipt reports `write_pending`. One budget per job:
 * every wait is `MAINTENANCE_WRITE_WAIT_MS`, capped by the job's remaining
 * deadline (no wait at or past it), and once one publish is still pending
 * after its wait the job's later publishes do not wait; they return
 * `write_pending` at once and are deferred like it. A pending write keeps its
 * request identity and commits later; it is never reported as committed.
