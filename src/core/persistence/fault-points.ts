/**
 * Named crash seams for the persistence gate (`scripts/persistence/`). Each
 * seam sits at a point where a process death leaves durable state the
 * recovery path must finish: publication boundaries, after an effect's side
 * effect but before its completion is recorded, before a recovery record is
 * cleared, between sync checkpoints, and after the consumer prepared a
 * claimed request. Production never installs a hook, so every call is a
 * no-op there; the gate's workers install one that SIGKILLs or stalls the
 * process at a chosen point.
