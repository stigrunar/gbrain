/**
 * How each API connector source (Google/GitHub) holds its pages.
 *
 * - `connector_database`: managed persistence, no worktree binding. The sync
 *   imports straight into the database (connector-sync.ts beginConnectorSync);
 *   any directory left at local_path is a pre-activation cache, not the pages'
 *   canonical copy.
 * - `bound`: managed persistence with a binding. The connector publishes
 *   canonical files under the bound root and keeps the ordinary repository
 *   contract.
 * - `unmanaged`: persistence is off. The sweep materializes a Markdown cache
 *   of the provider API under local_path.
 *
 * File-lane audits (doctor db_only pages, backup coverage) read this instead
 * of inferring DB-only storage from which files happen to exist.
