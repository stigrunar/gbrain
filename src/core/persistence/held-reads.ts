/**
 * #5988 read-time hold signals. A page whose newer file sync holds keeps its
 * last good revision, and a held new file has no page at all, so an agent
 * answering from reads must learn that coverage is partial:
 *
 * - `get_page` carries `file_held` (code, reason, key, line, since, fix, docs;
 *   the file path for trusted local callers only).
 * - search and query hits for such a page carry `stale` (held_since, last_indexed_revision).
 * - retrieval meta carries `held_files` per source in scope (held new files
 *   missing, held modified files stale) and a `held_files` degraded notice.
 *
 * Cost: one indexed lookup (`op_checkpoints_sync_hold_page_idx`) for the pages
 * a call returns and one read of the per-source summary rows in scope, each
 * cached per request (plus, only for a page whose held file is an
 * `invalid_fence` hold, the two reads that say whether the maintenance run
 * repairs it). Remote callers get codes, counts and flags, never paths, and a
 * fix addressed to the brain host operator; the repair commands come from the
 * hold router (D6): `gbrain repair fences` for fence holds, `gbrain repair
 * frontmatter` for the rest.
