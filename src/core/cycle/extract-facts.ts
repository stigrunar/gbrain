/**
 * v0.32.2 — extract_facts cycle phase.
 *
 * Reconciles the facts DB index from the `## Facts` fence on each
 * entity page. Runs between the `extract` phase (which materializes
 * links + timeline) and `recompute_emotional_weight` so emotional
 * weight sees fresh take + fact state.
 *
 * Source-of-truth contract: the fence is canonical. For each page in
 * the affected slug set, this phase:
 *   1. Reads the markdown body (DB-side fetch via engine.getPage).
 *   2. Parses the `## Facts` fence with parseFactsFence.
 *   3. Maps ParsedFact → FenceExtractedFact via extractFactsFromFenceText.
 *   4. Collapses duplicate ACTIVE rows with the same (claim, source).
 *   5. Reconciles the page-scoped DB index by fence row number: matched
 *      (row_num, claim) rows are updated in place (ids stay stable), rows
 *      that left the fence are expired and detached (never deleted), and
 *      only new row numbers insert. No-op when already in sync (#1781).
 *
 * Warning-bearing parses are non-authoritative and preserve that page's
 * existing index. A page with no fence expires and detaches its fence-owned
 * rows; `cli:` conversation facts and soft-expired legacy rows are not
 * fence-owned and are left alone. Active fence-owned rows of soft-deleted
 * pages are expired at the start of each run.
 *
 * Unfenced rows (#5299): each run first fences the source's active
 * `row_num IS NULL` rows onto their live entity pages through the shared
 * core pass (`facts/unfenced-facts.ts`, also the v0.32.2 migration's Phase
 * B) and reconciles those pages in the same run. The inline writer's
 * DB-only fallback keeps producing such rows, so no manual migration retry
 * is needed.
 *
 * Empty-fence guard (Codex R2-#7; #2484; #2646): rows the fence step could
 * not fence this run (a page whose file is not on this host, a malformed
 * fence, a held page lock) still block the destructive reconciliation pass
 * — in THIS run's source only (`source_id = sourceId`, the source-isolation
 * invariant). A row counts when `row_num IS NULL`, its `entity_slug`
 * resolves to a live page in this source, it is not soft-expired
 * (`expired_at IS NULL`; `forget_fact` drains rows that way) and the source
 * has a `local_path`. Status returns `warn` naming each failed page. Rows
 * with no backing page or checkout (slugify-floor / stub-guard-blocked
 * slugs from the inline writer) are structurally unfenceable and never gate.

 * #3625 (adversarial review, 2 rounds): whether `timeline` contains a

 * mentioned inside a fenced code example or quoted prose. A naive
 * `.includes(FACTS_FENCE_BEGIN)` false-positives on both — e.g. a page
 * whose real fence WAS removed, but whose timeline documents the fence
 * syntax in a ```markdown code block or a `> ...` blockquote, would wrongly
 * be treated as "misplaced" and block a genuine deletion, leaving stale
 * facts indexed indefinitely.
 *
 * Round 1 tried reusing fence-scan.ts's scanFencedBlocks() + string removal
 * of its extracted fence bodies. Round-2 adversarial review broke that:
 * scanFencedBlocks normalizes line endings (splits on `\r\n|\r|\n`, joins
 * fence bodies with plain `\n`) and strips opener indentation before
 * returning fence text — so `stripped.split(fenceText).join('')` on the
 * ORIGINAL (un-normalized) string silently fails to match a CRLF or
 * indented code block, leaving the marker inside it undetected and still
 * false-positive. Reconstructed-text removal can't safely undo a lossy
 * normalization.
 *
 * Fix: a self-contained single-pass line scanner (mirroring fence-scan.ts's
 * own CommonMark-subset opener/closer grammar, applied directly against
 * `timeline.split(/\r\n|\r|\n/)` — ONE split, no re-normalization, no
 * text-based removal) that skips lines between a real ``` /~~~ opener and
 * its closer, then checks whether any remaining line, trimmed, exactly
 * equals the marker. A real fence marker is always written as its own line
 * (see FENCE_BODY-shaped output from fence-write.ts / upsertFactRow), so
 * exact-line-match — on lines outside any code fence — rules out both
 * hazards without needing a full markdown AST (mirrors
 * findTimelineSplitIndex's own `trimmed === sentinel` pattern for the same
 * class of problem on the timeline sentinel itself). An unclosed opener
 * runs to EOF (matches fence-scan.ts's documented behavior) — a marker
 * appearing after it is inside an ambiguous, unclosed block and is not
