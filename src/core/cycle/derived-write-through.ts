/**
 * Opt-in markdown write-through for pages the dream cycle generates on an
 * unmanaged brain (#5041): atoms (`extract_atoms`) and concepts
 * (`synthesize_concepts`). Off by default, so the cycle never adds files to a
 * user's repository unasked; managed brains publish these pages through
 * maintenance publication instead and never reach this module.
 *
 * Enabled by `cycle.extract_atoms.write_through` /
 * `cycle.synthesize_concepts.write_through`. Each written page goes through
 * `writePageThrough` (honouring `sync.write_through=off`, source containment
 * and case collisions). A page whose target is ignored by git or sits in a
 * declared `storage.db_only` directory (which sync gitignores) stays
 * database-only. The first run after the key is enabled also writes the
 * generated pages that have no file yet, a bounded batch per run. A page the
 * phase retires has its file removed, so sync cannot bring it back.
