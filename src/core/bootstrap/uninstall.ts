/**
 * `gbrain bootstrap uninstall` — receipt-keyed removal of bootstrap-created
 * state [G2, S3#5, A2, CX2-12].
 *
 * Ownership model: uninstall is keyed to the MACHINE-LOCAL install receipt,
 * never to the repo-carried agent.json (template/attach clones inherit the
 * manifest but not the receipt). No receipt → nothing bootstrap-created on
 * this machine → refuse.
 *
 * Confinement invariants:
 *  - Removes EXACTLY `receipt.created_paths`, each validated with
 *    `isPathContained` under the gbrain home or the workspace. Anything that
 *    fails containment (including a symlink resolving outside) is SKIPPED with
 *    a reason, never followed.
 *  - Host registrations are returned as structured removal REQUESTS — the
 *    marker-keyed settings/TOML writers live in another module; this one never
 *    edits host config files.
 *  - NEVER wholesale-deletes the gbrain home: brain deletion removes only the
 *    PGLite data dir + the `bootstrap/` subdir + the receipt. Global
 *    config.json, clones/, and other sources SURVIVE [CX2-12].
 *  - Brain deletion runs ONLY when `deleteBrain` is requested AND the receipt
 *    says bootstrap created the brain [G2], behind a confirm whose message
 *    enumerates what is known WITHOUT opening an engine; a facts-export offer
 *    step is emitted first (facts are not derived state).
 *  - Refuses while a live process holds the PGLite data-dir lock (read-only
 *    lock-file probe — the engine is never opened) — "close your agent
 *    sessions first".
 *  - GBRAIN_HOME guard [S3#5]: with the env var set, requires an explicit
 *    home + containment in the workspace + the gbrain-home signature
 *    (config.json AND brain.pglite) before touching anything. A symlinked
 *    home is rejected via lstat.
