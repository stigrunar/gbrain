 *   - closer: same fence char, at least as long as the opener, nothing but
 *     trailing whitespace. The OTHER fence char never closes it.
 *   - unclosed fence runs to EOF.
 *   - lang = first whitespace-delimited info-string word (```ts title=x → ts).

/**
 * Where markdown code sits in a body, for deciding whether facts/takes fence
 * marker text is live: closed fenced code blocks (same opener/closer grammar as
 * scanFencedBlocks above) and inline code spans that open and close on the
 * same line. A page that documents the marker syntax in a ```markdown example
 * or a `backtick` mention is quoting the marker, not writing a fence.
 *
 * Fenced blocks are found up front in one line walk. Inline spans are only
 * needed on the few lines that hold a marker, so codeEndAt computes them for
 * that line on demand (spans never cross lines, so the answer is the same as
 * computing every line) and keeps the last line's spans for the next query.
 *
 * The two kinds of code are not equally reliable. An inline span is decided
 * within its own line. Whether a fenced block is closed depends on pairing
 * fence lines across the whole body, so one stray ``` far away shifts every
 * pairing after it: a stray opener pairs with the NEXT block's opener, and a
 * real fence between them reads as "inside a closed block". So:
 *   - fenced blocks are trusted only when the pairing shows no sign of a
 *     stray: every opener closes, and no block holds a line that could open a
 *     block as long as its own (correct nesting uses a longer outer fence).
 *     Otherwise `fenced` is empty and every marker outside an inline span
 *     stays live, exactly as before;
 *   - the privacy boundary (protectedRegions) never trusts fenced blocks at
 *     all: a real fence wrapped in a balanced code block must still be hidden;
 *   - inline spans are same-line only (a multi-line span stays live);
 *   - indented code blocks are not recognised (a fence line is never indented
 *     by four spaces in writer output, and the lazy-continuation rules would
 *     make a guess here fail open).
 * Offsets index the string as given (CRLF / CR line endings are preserved).
