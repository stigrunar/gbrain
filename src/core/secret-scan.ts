/**
 * secret-scan.ts — pattern-based secret detection for USER workspaces
 * (agent-bootstrap plan: ENG-9 as amended by CX2-15, S3#2, D6).
 *
 * Consumers: `gbrain sources push` (block-before-commit gate), bootstrap
 * verify, and the transcript-corpus writer (redact-in-place via
 * `redactFindings`).
 *
 * TWO SCAN POLICIES EXIST DELIBERATELY [CX2-15]: `.gitleaks.toml` is CI
 * fixture policy for THIS public repo (test/, skills/ are allowlisted there
 * because they hold synthetic fixtures). Importing that allowlist here would
 * blind the runtime scanner to real secrets under a user's personal-repo
 * `skills/` tree. This module therefore ships an EMPTY default allowlist
 * plus a per-workspace override file (`<ws>/.gbrain-scan-allow`, one
 * glob-or-fingerprint per line, `#` comments).
 *
 * Every surface prints the one canonical token `<REDACTED:pattern>` [ENG-9]:
 * finding previews splice the token over every claimed span in the preview
 * window, the corpus writer (`redactFindings`, or `planRedaction` +
 * `applyRedaction` for multi-field documents) splices it over each claimed
 * span and then scrubs bare echoes of the bearer / high-entropy values it
 * claimed (bounded, see there) — neither ever contains the secret value, and
 * this module never returns raw matched values.
 *
 * The generic high-entropy assignment heuristic is OFF by default (opt-in
 * via `ScanOpts.highEntropy`) — named-prefix patterns are precise; the
 * entropy heuristic trades false positives for recall and is a caller
 * decision, not a default.

// ── Patterns ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Each core pattern is compiled with a left boundary group `(^|[^A-Za-z0-9_])`
// so prefixes embedded inside longer identifiers ("risk-assessment…",
// "task-…") never fire. Order matters: 'anthropic' precedes 'openai' and the
// per-line claimed-span set prevents a `sk-ant-…` key from double-reporting
// as a generic `sk-` match.
//
// FORMAT-BASED, not prefix-only. Credentials without a vendor prefix (a JWT,
// an account SID, a connection string carrying its password) are matched on
// their WIRE SHAPE. Fixed-length shapes carry a trailing negative lookahead so
// a longer alphanumeric run (a digest, an identifier) is not cut into a
// false "key". The CATCH-ALLS (`bearer`, `db_url_credentials`,
// `url_credentials`, `basic_auth`) are appended LAST on purpose: the per-line
// claimed-span dedupe is first-wins for ATTRIBUTION, so `Bearer <vendor key>` keeps its vendor attribution and
// a JWT used as a URL password is reported as `jwt` once — while COVERAGE is
// the union: whatever part of the later catch-all span the earlier claim did
// not cover (the userinfo around that JWT) is still claimed by the catch-all
// (see scanInternal).

/**
 * Private-key claims over the WHOLE text (a PEM key spans lines, so the
 * per-line scanner cannot see its body). One source of truth for the scanner
 * and for `privateKeySpans` (retrieval projection). Three claim kinds:
 *
 * - BLOCK: a `BEGIN … PRIVATE KEY` fence whose next fence is an END fence
 *   within PEM_BODY_MAX_CHARS. The claim is header through END, whatever lies
 *   between (unchanged from the whole-block regex, except that a block never
 *   swallows a later BEGIN: a truncated key followed by a complete one is two
 *   claims, and the prose between them survives).
 * - FORWARD (BEGIN with no END in view: a snippet cap or excerpt cut the key
 *   off): the header plus the body lines that follow it.
 * - BACKWARD (END with no BEGIN in view: a chunk that starts mid-key): the
 *   body lines before the END fence plus the fence. An END fence with no body
 *   line before it (a marker quoted in prose) is no claim at all.
 *
 * A BODY LINE is a whole-line run of base64 characters (`A-Za-z0-9+/=`),
 * optionally indented by up to PEM_INDENT_MAX spaces/tabs and followed by up
 * to that much trailing whitespace. Line ends are `\n`, `\r\n`, or the
 * literal two-character `\n` / four-character `\r\n` escapes of a
 * JSON-serialized key. Interior lines are PEM_LINE_MIN..PEM_LINE_MAX chars;
 * the line adjacent to a fence and a partial line at a cut (the end of the
 * text going forward, the start of the text going backward) may be
 * 1..PEM_LINE_MAX. A line holding anything else after its indentation
 * (prose, a space inside the run) ends the body, and so does a run longer
 * than PEM_LINE_MAX (not claimed). Going forward, optional RFC 1421 header
 * lines (`Proc-Type:`, `DEK-Info:`) and one blank line may follow the BEGIN
 * line. A header followed by no body line (a marker quoted in prose, or text
 * on the header's own line) is claimed alone, as before.
 *
 * Total claimed body stays within PEM_BODY_MAX_CHARS (an RSA-4096 PEM is
 * ~3.3 KB, RSA-16384 ~12.5 KB); past it the remainder is the accepted miss.
 * Accepted misses: body on the header's own line, space-joined single-line
 * keys, blockquoted (`> `) keys, and runs over PEM_LINE_MAX chars.
 *
 * LINEAR TIME. The fences are found by two global regex passes and merged in
 * text order; each walk stops at the neighbouring fence or at the end of the
 * previous claim, so walks never overlap and every character is visited a
 * bounded number of times (20k unterminated BEGIN fences, 20k END-only
 * fences and 1 MB of base64 lines are pinned in
 * test/secret-scan-perf.test.ts). There is no forward regex that starts at
 * every base64 line.

// Opt-in: `secret|token|password|api key`-shaped assignment whose value has

// layout matches the core patterns: group 1 = anchor, group 2 = value).
//
// The left boundary is [^A-Za-z0-9] rather than the core patterns'
// [^A-Za-z0-9_]: `_` has to read as a SEPARATOR here, or `api_access_token`
// and `SMTP_PASSWORD` cannot match their own keyword. The core patterns keep
// `_` as a word character on purpose (a vendor prefix inside a longer
// identifier must not fire); this rule is keyword-anchored, so the same
// reasoning inverts. The keyword is also allowed trailing identifier
// segments before the assignment, or `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=` cannot match:
// the keyword `SECRET` is not adjacent to the `=`, `_ACCESS_KEY` is. The
// entropy gate still decides, so a wider anchor costs nothing on prose.
//
// The value floor is 12, not 20. A 16-character SMTP password sat under the
// old floor and stayed plaintext in the receipt on disk even once the keyword
// matched — the value length was doing gating the entropy check is there to
// do. Real passwords are frequently 12-16 characters; secrets that long with
// 3.5 bits/char of entropy are not prose.
//
// The value must ALSO contain at least one digit. Identifier-shaped values
// (`DefaultAzureCredential`, `/usr/local/bin/aws-vault`, an env-var NAME
// assigned to an `apiKeyEnvVar`) clear the entropy gate on mixed case and
// separators alone and were being redacted out of ordinary code. Real
// machine-minted secrets essentially always carry digits; a digitless
// passphrase is the accepted miss. A 40-hex git sha assigned to a `token:`
// key still redacts (digits + entropy) — documented, acceptable.
//
// Both quantifiers after the keyword are BOUNDED. The trailing identifier
// segments used to be `[A-Za-z0-9_-]*`: because the left boundary admits `-`
// and `_` and that class contains them too, every `-`/`_` in a run like
// `-apikey-apikey…` or `_token_token…` was a fresh keyword start whose
// suffix ran to end-of-line and backtracked — quadratic (210 KB of
// `-apikey` took ~35 s, 180 KB of `_token` ~15 s). At `{0,64}` a start does
// constant work; no real credential key carries 64 identifier characters
// after its keyword. The value is capped at 4096 for the same
// constant-work-per-occurrence guarantee (the jwt segments share the cap):
// a value longer than that is redacted only through its first 4096 chars —
// the accepted miss, well above any real token or base64 key blob.
//
// The 3.5 bits/char floor is judged on the bias-corrected (Miller-Madow)
// estimate, not the raw per-character Shannon entropy. The raw figure of an
// n-character string can never exceed log2(n) (3.58 at 12 characters, 3.91
// at 15) and drops sharply with a single repeated character, so the raw
// floor rejected 68% of uniformly random 12-character alphanumeric secrets,
// 9% at 15 and 5% at 16: exactly the 12-16 character passwords the 12-char
// value floor exists to catch (a 15-character value such as `!dcG4Gmw1qGRbR3`
// after a password key stayed plaintext).
// Miller-Madow adds (distinct - 1) / (2 n ln 2), which cuts those misses
// below 1% at every length from 12 up and is negligible on long values.
// Because the correction can lift an all-digit value past the floor, the
// value must also carry a non-digit: counters, timestamps and numeric ids
// (`token_count=1234567890123`) never reached 3.5 raw bits (log2(10) = 3.32)
// and still never redact.

// ── Corpus-write redaction ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// [S3#2] `redactFindings` replaces every CLAIMED span in place with
// `<REDACTED:pattern>` and reports what was redacted. Allowlisted values are
// left intact — the user declared them safe. The output is rebuilt by
// SPAN-SPLICE, O(text + hits): every hit carries its absolute offset from
// scanInternal, the spans are sorted by offset, and the text between
// consecutive spans is copied through once. (The previous implementation ran
// one full-text `replaceAll` per unique (pattern, value) pair — O(unique
// values × text): a 1 MB transcript with ~5k unique high-entropy values took
// ~3-5 s to redact after a ~70 ms scan.)
//
// `redactions` is one finding per CLAIMED span, in scan order (PEM blocks,
// then line order). A span the union-coverage rule split around an earlier
// claim contributes one record per uncovered slice; an echo (below) adds no
// record — it is not a claim.
//
// SEMANTIC DELTA from the replaceAll form (deliberate): the splice redacts
// exactly the claimed spans, so for every pattern OUTSIDE the echo pass
// `redactFindings(text).text` agrees byte-for-byte with what `scanText(text)`
// reports — a claimed value's bytes at a position the scanner did not claim
// (embedded past its left boundary inside a longer identifier) are left
// as-is, and the corpus write and the push gate see the same findings.
// Vendor-prefixed values lose nothing by staying outside the echo pass: they
// re-match on their own wherever they recur.
//
// THE ECHO PASS. A `bearer` token is claimed only where its `Bearer ` keyword
// anchors it and a `high_entropy_assignment` value only where its keyword
// does, yet transcripts routinely echo the same value bare (`Authorization:
// Bearer <tok>` in a tool call, then `<tok>` alone in the reply; a pasted
// `PASSWORD=<v>` line, then `<v>` in prose). So the values those two patterns
// claim form an ECHO DICTIONARY (value → pattern) and every remaining
// occurrence — bare, or embedded inside a longer identifier — is redacted as
// that pattern's token too. Three bounds keep the pass cheap and
// collision-safe: a value must clear its pattern's floor
// (ECHO_MIN_CHARS_BEARER = 20, ECHO_MIN_CHARS_ENTROPY = 12 — the rules' own
// floors, restated so a pattern edit alone can never widen the pass to
// short, collision-prone values), must be at most ECHO_MAX_VALUE_CHARS long,
// and only the first ECHO_MAX_UNIQUE unique values in claim order — ONE cap
// across both patterns — join. A value past either cap is still redacted at
// its claimed span; only its echoes are the accepted miss.
//
// The pass is a streaming merge over the ORIGINAL text: per value, the
// position of its next occurrence at or beyond the emit cursor (found by
// `indexOf` resuming at the cursor); at each step the leftmost-longest
// occurrence that fits inside the current UNCLAIMED GAP is emitted and the
// cursor advances. Retained state is O(values) however long the text is —
// occurrences are never collected into a list, which on a repetitive tail
// (2 MiB of `A` against 64 claimed values of 20–83 `A`s) meant ~3 M candidate
// objects and ~230 MB of RSS for 64 findings, ahead of message truncation.
// Two earlier forms were also wrong on time: one `replaceAll` per unique
// value was O(unique × text) (why the count cap exists), and a single
// escaped-alternation RegExp was O(text × Σ|values|) on prefix-sharing
// values — 64 claimed bearer values of 4 KB sharing a 4000-char prefix ahead
// of a 1 MB tail of the prefix character took ~24 s (the bearer class is
// unbounded, so an attacker-influenced page can plant them); the per-value
// substring seeks take milliseconds on the same input, and the value-length
// cap bounds each compare. Matching only ever runs over the original text,
// never over emitted `<REDACTED:…>` tokens: a claimed bearer value that
// spells a pattern name (`high_entropy_assignment` is 23 bearer-class
// characters) used to turn a sibling token into `<REDACTED:<REDACTED:bearer>>`
// when the pass ran over the spliced output.
//
// SESSION-WIDE DICTIONARY. A multi-field document (a transcript session:
// message bodies, speaker labels, title, metadata values) must scrub an echo
// in one field of a value claimed in ANOTHER. `planRedaction` scans one
// field and adds its eligible values to a caller-supplied shared map under
// the same floors and the same single cap; `applyRedaction` splices later and
// reads the map as it stands THEN — so a caller plans every field first and
// applies afterwards, and a value claimed in the last field is scrubbed from
// the first. `redactFindings` is the one-shot composition for a single text.
