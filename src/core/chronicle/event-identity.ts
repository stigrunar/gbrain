/**
 * Life Chronicle event identity: same-day disambiguation.
 *
 * `buildChronicleEvent` slugs an event `life/events/<day>-<hash8>` with the
 * hash over who, what and the depth page. Two proposals of one depth page
 * that share who, what and day (two "Call with alice-example" on one day)
 * get the same base slug. Publication resolves each such group here:
 *
 *   - An event's discriminator is its instant (`when`, normalized), `where`
 *     and `kind`, the fields a group's members can differ in.
 *   - One member keeps the bare base slug; every other distinct member gets
 *     `<base>-<hash6>`, the hash over its discriminator. Identical copies
 *     beyond the first get `-2`, `-3`.
 *   - Assignment reads the pages already at the candidate slugs, so it
 *     survives reordering, corrections and re-runs: the member whose
 *     discriminator the base page holds keeps the base slug, a member whose
 *     suffixed slug already exists (live or retired) keeps it, and only then
 *     does the earliest remaining member (by instant, then discriminator)
 *     take a free base slug. A page extracted before disambiguation keeps
 *     its base slug.
 *
 * Ownership, operator protection and retirement stay with publish.ts: an
 * assigned slug is written only when the extractor owns it.
