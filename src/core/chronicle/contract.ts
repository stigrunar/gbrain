/**
 * Life Chronicle automatic extraction contract (#5876): the ledger columns,
 * the phase bounds and the `chronicle` cycle-phase result. The reason codes
 * and the `chronicle_backstop` receipt live in reasons.ts (the one table);
 * the config keys and defaults live in config.ts.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   1. A coordinated page publication (put_page, capture, edit_page,
 *      restore_page, revert_version, managed sync and connector imports)
 *      records one `chronicle_page_state` row for the published content in
 *      the same transaction (`pending` or `skipped` + reason) and returns the
 *      `chronicle_backstop` receipt hint. Unmanaged brains have no write
 *      decision; the phase scans their pages directly.
 *   2. The global `chronicle` cycle phase claims settled `pending` rows whose
 *      content is still live, takes a rolling daily reservation, runs the
 *      judge under a BudgetTracker scope, publishes events, reconciles the
 *      previous generation and records the outcome on the row.
 *   3. `gbrain chronicle-backfill` records `pending` rows with
 *      trigger='backfill' (exempt from the daily limit and recency rule);
 *      the same phase executes them.
