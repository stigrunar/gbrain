 * #5449/#5284: PGLite runs Postgres as one in-process backend with no
 * checkpointer. When WAL since the last redo point reaches the automatic
 * trigger, Postgres runs the checkpoint inline inside whatever WAL write
 * crossed the segment boundary, and on PGLite 0.4.x that nested checkpoint
 * spins forever at 100% CPU. The guard keeps the automatic trigger from ever
 * firing mid-transaction: before an outermost write transaction begins, it
 * runs a top-level CHECKPOINT once WAL since redo passes half of the trigger
 * distance (256 MB with the default 1 GB max_wal_size). A write statement run
 * outside engine.transaction() is its own outermost transaction and takes the
 * same guard (`writesWal`).
