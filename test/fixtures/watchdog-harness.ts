/**
 * Fixture for test/process-watchdog-harness.test.ts. Spawned via `bun`.
 *
 * Usage: bun watchdog-harness.ts <mode> <deadlineMs> <graceMs>
 *   starve-with    — install the watchdog, then starve the event loop forever.
 *                    The watchdog must SIGKILL this process by deadline+grace.
 *   starve-without — no watchdog, just starve. Proves the busy loop truly hangs
 *                    (the test kills it). Isolates the watchdog as cause of death.
 *   clean-dispose  — install with a long deadline, dispose immediately, exit 0.
 *                    The watchdog must NOT kill a cleanly-disposed process.
 *
 * Loop-stall watchdog modes (#4281) — <deadlineMs> is the stall threshold:
 *   stall-with     — register an inert SIGTERM listener (so the OS default
 *                    disposition can't kill us — mirrors serve-http, whose
 *                    process-cleanup SIGTERM handler can't run when the loop
 *                    is starved), install the stall watchdog, starve forever.
 *                    The watchdog must SIGTERM at ~stall, then SIGKILL at
 *                    ~stall+grace.
 *   stall-healthy  — install the stall watchdog and stay HEALTHY (idle loop,
 *                    pets flowing) well past stall+grace. Neither signal may
 *                    fire; a false SIGTERM prints TERMED and exits 1.
 *   stall-dispose  — install, dispose immediately, then genuinely starve past
 *                    stall+grace. A disposed watchdog must never kill.
 *
 * Progress-aware deadline modes (large-brain sync, F4d) — argv[5] is the
 * progress window in ms:
 *   progress-with   — install a progress-aware watchdog, then keep reporting
 *                     forward progress (noteForwardProgress every 25ms) for
 *                     4x the deadline. Must NOT be stopped; prints COMPLETED.
 *   progress-stalls — report progress for half the deadline, then idle (loop
 *                     responsive, no progress). Must be SIGTERMed one window
 *                     after the last progress note, after printing the
 *                     STOP-NOTICE stop notice on stdout.
 *
 * Safety net: the busy loop self-exits after 8s so a failed test kill can't hang CI.
