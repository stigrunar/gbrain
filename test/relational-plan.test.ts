/**
 * Multi-relation planner (pure). Development frames written for this test;
 * the held-out composed-question wording in gbrain-evals is deliberately not
 * mirrored.
 *
 * Protects: 2-3 relation questions become anchor-outward hop chains with the
 * right direction per surface form; coordination, negation, time and
 * multi-entity questions are refused (never guessed); single-relation queries
 * stay `not_applicable` so the one-hop parser keeps them.
