/**
 * #5917 / #5911: S8 grounding judges the interpretation around valid evidence.
 *
 * Protects: a unit whose quote, number or speaker mention passes the
 * mechanical checks still reaches the opt-in S8 judge (with its final quote
 * repairs), so "attended the conference" around a valid ticket quote can be
 * quarantined. Fails when: verifyBody exempts quoted, attributed or numeric
 * units from groundingUnits again, or hands S8 the pre-repair text the
 * quarantine reducer cannot find. Why new: the existing slot test pinned the
 * old exemption.
