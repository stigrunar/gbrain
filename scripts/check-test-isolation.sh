# CI guard: fail if any non-serial unit test file violates intra-process
# isolation rules. The v0.26.4 parallel runner loads multiple test files
# into one bun process per shard; module-level state (env vars, PGLite
# engines, mock.module overrides) leaks across files in that process and
# silently flakes other tests.
#
# Rules enforced (non-serial unit test files only):
#  R1: no `process.env.X = ...`, `process.env['X'] = ...`,
#      `delete process.env.X`, `Object.assign(process.env, ...)`,
#      `Reflect.set(process.env, ...)` mutations. Use withEnv() helper or
#      rename the file to `*.serial.test.ts`.
#  R2: no `mock.module(...)` anywhere. Top-level module mocks affect every
#      other file in the same shard process. Rename to `*.serial.test.ts`.
#  R3: `new PGLiteEngine(` may only appear within ~50 lines following a
#      `beforeAll(` line. Engines created at module scope (or in describe
#      bodies) leak across files in the shard process.
#  R4: any file that creates `new PGLiteEngine(` must call `.disconnect(`
#      inside an `afterAll(` block. Without disconnect, engines leak across
#      file boundaries within a shard process.
#  R5: a file whose code calls `configureGateway(` must also call
#      `resetGateway(` in its code (normally from afterAll/afterEach). The
#      AI gateway is one object per process, so whatever a file configures
#      (embedding model and width, keys, base URLs) is still in force for
#      the next file the shard loads, and that file's PGLite schema is sized
#      from it: eval-canary once failed "expected 1280 dimensions, not 1536"
#      after a reshuffle ran a LiteLLM-configuring file first. Comments do
#      not count either way. A file whose only calls run inside a spawned
#      child's script string carries `isolation-lint: R5-subprocess-only`.
#
# Scope:
#  - Recursively scans `test/**/*.test.ts`.
#  - Skips `*.serial.test.ts` entirely (the quarantine escape hatch).
#  - Skips `test/e2e/**` (E2E runs sequentially in its own runner; not in
#    the parallel pool).
#
# Allow-list:
#  Files in `scripts/check-test-isolation.allowlist` (one filename per
#  line, # comments allowed) are skipped. This exists because v0.26.7
#  ships the lint as a foundation; v0.26.8 (env sweep) and v0.26.9
#  (PGLite sweep) remove entries as files get fixed. New files MUST NOT
#  be added — the allow-list shrinks over time, never grows.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-test-isolation.sh [TARGET_DIR]
#        scripts/check-test-isolation.sh --as-parallel FILE...
#   --as-parallel lints the named files (serial ones included) as if they
#   ran in the parallel pool: the check a *.serial.test.ts file must pass
#   before it rejoins the unit lane (scripts/serial-files.tsv).
# Exit:  0 when clean, 1 when un-allow-listed violations found.
