# loadAgents is defined) before they reach E2E. Codex flagged this gap
# during the PR #586 review pass — five Claude review passes missed
# the loadApiKeys reference because the bash test pipeline doesn't run
# Vite builds. This script runs `bun install` in admin/ to ensure
# react/vite/etc. are present, then runs Vite's build which performs
# TypeScript type-check + bundle.

# Skip with GBRAIN_SKIP_ADMIN_BUILD=1 (e.g., for fast inner-loop test
# runs that don't touch admin/src). Production CI must NOT skip.
