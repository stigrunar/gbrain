# `ci:local:diff` and `ci:ubicloud:diff` skip every test lane when the diff is
# doc-only (scripts/select-e2e.ts classifies it DOC_ONLY); these checks still
# run, because a doc edit can leave generated or guarded artifacts stale:
# llms.txt freshness, KEY_FILES / TESTING.md byte caps and current-state
# voice, documented repository paths, skill references and the privacy guards.
# Every check runs; the exit code is 1 if any failed, and each failure prints
# its repair command.
